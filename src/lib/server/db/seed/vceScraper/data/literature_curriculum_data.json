(Teacher can scaffold this by modelling an interpretation of an extract with students posing questions about the process.) Working collaboratively, the class develops and documents a process for annotating and then interpreting an extract from a set text. Collaboratively construct a scaffold to work with postcolonial theory and ideas. For example, develop a set of key quotes and / or definitions about postcolonialism. Apply a developing understanding of postcolonialism to a written analysis of an extract. Teacher assigns a significant passage from a set text, and guides the analysis through focus questions so that students begin to find their voice in this work. Following this scaffolded work, write an interpretation of a set text from a postcolonial perspective, addressing a topic that sits within a specific area of focus (students might choose to write their own topics). Individually or in groups, deliver oral presentations that explore the role of postcolonial thought in the reading of a set text(s). This can be a personal reflection and / or an exploration of the journey taken through the area of study.",

In pairs, summarise and analyse extracts from the texts with regard to the social, historical and cultural context(s).

Research the historical, social, cultural, economic, political contexts of the set text and present findings in a linear timeline that establishes links between certain real events and the narrative of the text; for example, the events / personalities in the French Revolution and the events in Dickens’ ATale of Two Cities. Research the author of a text and identify biographical factors (historical, social, economic, political) that might have had an impact on the context of the text. Using the research, construct an extended piece of writing adopting the role of the author and speculating about the writer’s ideas and concerns.

In these profiles, the ideas and concerns of characters should be established through explicit textual evidence and compared to the ideas and concerns of the text’s context.

Create the character’s answers using the views and values on particular ideas and concerns that are evident in the text. With characters from a text allocated to individual class members, create a panel made up of these characters (in a forum setting). Other class members question the characters about their views on certain social, cultural and historical concerns. ‘In character’, the panel members answer and debate the questions according to how they are portrayed in the text.

Students may: compare a dramatised version of a scene or scenes from a text with the original text compare a print text with the text’s adaptation into another form.  Close analysis. Close analysis of a passage from the selected text. Comparative response exploring the ways meaning changes when the text form changes. Example 1 The comparative response can invite students to explore a central concern of the texts. For example: ‘Austen’s actively critiques the limitations of class in Persuasion while the 2022 adaption of Persuasion (dir. Carrie Cracknell) is only really interested in mining class for comedy.’ How far do you agree?"

Students are invited to explore a key idea or value in the text and consider how the text has presented and represented that concern or value. They could, for example, explore the ways a text has presented and represented isolation or power or marriage. Part B is assessed after students consider the supplementary reading. Students revisit the key concern or value through a passage from the set text and provide an enhanced interpretation informed by the supplementary reading."

Part A is assessed through a reading journal; students produce a reading journal with an agreed number of sustained entries about key concerns, values and/or ideas drawn from the text. The reading journal can be kept in class and teachers can complete authentication checks on student work. Part B is undertaken under examination conditions and students respond closely to a passage from the set text. Students write an enhanced interpretation of the passage developed from both their close reading of the set text, developing their initial ideas from their reading journal, and from the supplementary reading."

Assessment mandated in the Study Design – A close analysis of a text, supported by an examination of textual details, based on a selection of passages. Sample approaches Close analysis of three passages from the selected text. The end of year examination can offer some guidance with this assessment task. The prompt to write in Section B of the examination has remained largely unchanged through multiple study designs and invites students to ‘use … set passages as the basis for a discussion of [set text]. Teachers can employ some version of this invitation and can be guided by the length of the passages set in the external examination in their own selections for internal assessment. Note that the order of the passages set in the examination is always sequential according to the text from which they have been selected. It is important to always modify any examination material for internal assessment tasks in order to maintain the integrity of the assessment task and to provide fair and equitable conditions for students."
