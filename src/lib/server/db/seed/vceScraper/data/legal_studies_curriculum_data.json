Possible laws for study could include Criminal laws : students research those laws applicable to them personally; for example: laws governing drivers licences, wearing of bike helmets, travel on public transport, as well as criminal laws for both summary and indictable offences. Equal opportunity laws : students research the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act to identify the types of discrimination outlawed. A focus of the study could be amendments to the Summary Offences Amendment (Nazi Symbol Prohibition) Act 2022 that bans use of the Nazi salute as an example of a law that seeks to promote social cohesion. Workplace laws : students research the recent introduction of the ‘workplace manslaughter laws’ in Victoria. Taxation laws : students identify the types of taxes levied by both Commonwealth and State governments on Victorians. Consumer laws : students research Federal and Victorian laws that aim to protect consumers from misleading conducts by businesses.

Suggested focus questions: What were the facts of the case? Why did this case attract so much community and media interest? Why did the DPP accept a plea negotiation from Mr Ristevski to plead guilty for manslaughter on the eve of his trial for murder? What was the important practical consequence for Mr Ristevski of the DPP accepting a guilty plea for the lesser charge? What was Mr Ristevski’ s original sentence for manslaughter? Why was this sentence changed after an appeal by the DPP against the leniency of the sentence? Explain how this case reinforces the importance of mens rea and actus reus as elements of a crime.

Using the principles of the civil law of negligence students answer the following questions: Who are the plaintiff(s)? What is a representative proceeding? Who is the defendant in the action? What is the legal wrong claimed by the plaintiff(s)? What evidence have the plaintiff(s) used to establish that the defendant has committed a civil wrong? What is the loss that the plaintiff(s) claim they have suffered? What do they argue is the link between the actions of the defendant and their loss? What remedy have the plaintiff(s) sought? Students research the contract dispute between Israel Folau and Rugby Australia and answer the following questions: What is a contract? What legal obligations does it impose? What is a breach of contract? Why did Rugby Australia claim that Israel Folau had breached his contract? What was Israel Folau’s legal argument? How was the civil dispute resolved?"

Scenario Sam was leaving the work car park in her new car when she was involved in a car crash with her workmate, Alex, who was also leaving the car park. Alex and Sam disagreed about who was at fault, and a heated argument took place in the car park. Alex was driving an expensive sports car that was extensively damaged as a result of the accident. Sam’s car was also extensively damaged but her car was much less expensive to repair. Alex, who was uninsured has sent Sam a letter demanding that she pay the repair bill for his sports car. Sam does not think she is at fault and has refused to pay. After receiving the letter, Sam asked her colleagues what they witnessed, most of the eyewitnesses believed the crash was Alex’s fault. Sam has received a written warning from the boss because some of her colleagues complained that they felt pressured by Sam to take sides in the dispute. Meanwhile, Alex received a written warning from the boss after he interrupted an important work meeting Sam was running to yell at her demanding payment for his car. This harmed Alex’s chance for promotion at work, and has made Sam feel isolated and lonely in a workplace where she used to enjoy working. Alex is considering civil legal action against Sam for the cost of repairing his sports car. It has been recommended however that they attempt a form of dispute resolution first. It is suggested that this will enable Alex and Sam to find a way to repair their working relationship, as well as a resolution for the cost of repairing the cars. Instructions Working in groups of three, select an appropriate method of dispute resolution (conciliation, mediation or arbitration) to use in resolving this dispute. Allocate each member of the group to a different role: plaintiff, defendant, impartial third party (conciliator / mediator / arbitrator). Attempt to resolve the dispute using your chosen dispute resolution method using a role-play. Consider and identify: The strengths and weaknesses of different dispute resolution methods The most appropriate dispute resolution method for this case Possible remedies the plaintiff might seek in this case The factors the plaintiff should consider before initiating a civil claim in this case The factors that affect the ability of the civil justice system to achieve the principles of justice in this case."

      "task": "On completion of this unit the student should be able to explain the key principles of the criminal justice system, discuss the ability of sanctions to achieve their purposes and evaluate the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve the principles of justice during a criminal case. Step 1: Identify the nature and sequence of teaching and learning activities used to cover the key knowledge and key skills outlined in the area of study. Ensure that these provide for different learning styles. The teaching and learning activities included in the support materials for Unit 3 Outcome 1 account for different learning styles and will allow students to build and consolidate their knowledge. Build in opportunities for students to practise and develop skills in responding to different types of assessment within class activities on a regular basis. Step 2: Develop the task. Look carefully at Outcome 1 and then the key knowledge and key skills relevant to this statement. Note any other relevant points from the area of study and how key knowledge relates to the principles of justice. Also look at the introductory statement to the area of study and the unit overall. Finally, look at the relevant performance descriptors. All of this information will provide a clear guide as to the specific key knowledge and key skills that could be assessed through this task. Make a list or summary of the assessable items to refer to when designing specific questions. For example, the following key knowledge and key skills could be assessed in Unit 3 Area of Study 1 and questions could be designed around all or some. Explain the key principles of the criminal justice system. Discuss the ability of criminal sanctions to achieve their purposes. Evaluate the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve the principles of justice during a criminal case. Define and use legal terminology. Grasp and apply key knowledge. Synthesise and apply legal principles and information to actual and / or hypothetical scenarios. Discuss, interpret and analysis legal principles and information. Examples of possible question types: Lower order: Identify… Outline the key features of… Medium order: Explain how… Discuss… (a simple concept or concepts) Higher order: Discuss…in relation to the principles of justice. Compare… Apply key knowledge to the scenario. Note: When allocating marks and designating questions as lower, medium or higher order, consider a combination of the following: complexity and difficulty of the skills inherent within the task word complexity or difficulty of the key knowledge required within a response volume of key knowledge to be considered or included within the response. Step 3: Select the task type from the range of options listed in the study design. [For this task: structured questions.] Step 4: Decide on the conditions under which the task will be conducted and include this in instructions to students. Given that this outcome is worth 50 marks out of the 100 marks available for School-assessed Coursework in Unit 3, it may be appropriate to have students complete only one task or to split the assessment of the outcome over two tasks, each covering different key knowledge points. Closed book test conditions: no notes or textbooks permitted and students to be supervised while undertaking the assessment Timing: 50 minutes to complete the task. This allows for 10 minutes of reading time, then 40 minutes to complete the written responses to structured questions. Step 5: Design the task. Consider the key knowledge points and assessable items above. In Area of Study 1 students need to be familiar with the key knowledge concepts related to the Victorian criminal justice system, the principles of justice during a criminal case, and sentencing. Note that the final key skill outcome requires students to ‘apply legal principles and information to actual and / or hypothetical scenarios’. One way to do this is to prepare stimulus material about the Victorian criminal justice system. Stimulus material could take the form of excerpts from judicial sentencing remarks, news articles or political cartoons concerning the criminal justice system, hypothetical criminal scenarios, or a combination of multiple types of stimulus. Include questions that require students to recall (lower order), discuss (medium order) and apply / synthesise (higher order) to allow students opportunity to clearly demonstrate their best performance level. Structured questions should relate to the scenario(s) as described in the stimulus material, allowing students to demonstrate their ability to apply key knowledge and key skills to scenarios. The task words used for the structured questions should be based on the key skills listed for the outcome. Prepare 25% lower order questions, 50% medium order questions and 25% higher order questions. This will allow for a spread of marks and a ranking of students to occur. Step 6: Provide students with a SAC Notification Sheet, advising them of the content of the forthcoming SAC. Step 7: Conduct the assessment task. Step 8: Mark the task and rank students. The marking scheme used to assess a student’s level of performance should reflect the relevant aspects of the performance descriptors and be explained to students before they commence the task. With structured questions, it may be appropriate to allocate marks for each answer. However, the marks allocated should reflect the degree of difficulty or complexity required by task words. These, in turn, should be based on the key skills listed for the outcome. The performance descriptor / rubrics provided are a useful guide to ranking/assessing student work. Authentication Teachers are required to authenticate that work submitted by students is the result of their own efforts. Further details about authentication of student work is available in the VCE Administrative Handbook for the current year. Assessment rubrics / performance descriptors will provide a guide to the levels of performance typically demonstrated within each range on the assessment task(s). The performance descriptors for each outcome identify the qualities or characteristics expected in a student response at different level of achievement."
