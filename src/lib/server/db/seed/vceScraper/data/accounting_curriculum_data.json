Teachers should be familiar with the relevant key knowledge and key skills related to the specific outcome being assessed in order to plan an assessment task. It should be noted that it is usually not feasible, nor expected, to assess every key knowledge and key skill dot point, nor should the task focus on too narrow a range of key knowledge and key skills. Aim to assess a representative sample of key knowledge and key skills listed within the area of study.

Students may be given revision activities and exercises in preparation for the assessment task. Step 4: Design the assessment task It is recommended that assessment tasks be completed in class under supervision and within a limited time frame. The overall assessment program for the unit should include a variety of assessment task formats, as well as provision for authentication of student work. Student workload should also be taken into account. Schools may determine the conditions for each task. Students should be advised of the timeline and conditions under which the task is to be completed. The assessment task must directly assess the studentsâ€™ grasp of the key knowledge and key skills, as well as their ability to apply these to the task, and hence demonstrate achievement of the outcome to be assessed. The School-assessed Coursework task for Unit 3 Area of Study 1 is worth 60 marks of the 100 marks available for internal assessment of Unit 3. It should be completed at the end of teaching of Area of Study 1 in order to ensure that students have been exposed to, and had sufficient opportunity to grasp, the specified key knowledge and key skills. The exact dates and times for assessment to occur is a school-based decision that may be determined after consultation with students, VCE coordinators and other key staff. Clear instructions should be given regarding the requirements of the task, including criteria, time allocation and format. The task should be unambiguous, and the requirements of the responses should be explicitly stated. The marking scheme used to assess a studentâ€™s level of performance should reflect the relevant aspects of the performance descriptors and be explained to students before commencement of the task. Suggested approach to construction of the assessment task: Construct a brief case study presenting students with financial data relating to a double entry system, the General Journal, General Ledger and inventory cards. Design questions and tasks requiring students to record this data using a double entry system, analyse and justify their treatment, use and interpretation of the data. Students could also be required to explain the role of the General Journal, General Ledger and inventory cards in the recording process. Students should be asked to describe, discuss and analyse various aspects of the accounting system. Studentsâ€™ understanding of relevant ethical considerations should also be assessed. Sources such as commercially produced School-assessed Coursework materials, financial reports and data, textbooks and the media can all be used as stimulus when designing a SAC assessment and developing questions. These materials must however be adapted and modified to ensure that the SAC task created is unique to the school within the specific academic year. Ensure that questions developed specifically address and assess studentsâ€™ understanding and grasp of the key knowledge and key skills relevant to the Area of Study and Outcome. Allocation of marks This task for Unit 3 Outcome 1 is worth 60 marks towards the total of 100 marks allocated to School-assessed Coursework for Unit 3. Please note that the VCE Accounting Study Design stipulates that at least 30 marks must be allocated to ICT-based assessment in Unit 3. The teacher may decide the most appropriate time to deliver this task and must inform the students ahead of the decided date. This decision will involve considerations including: the estimated time it will take to teach the key knowledge and skills for the outcome the likely length of time required for students to complete the task when and which SAC tasks being delivered in other subjects and resulting student workload implications."

Step 1: Define the parameters of the outcome and its related assessment options The VCE Accounting Study Design pages 33â€“34 provides details of the key knowledge and key skills related to Unit 4 Outcome 2 and its corresponding area of study, â€˜Budgeting and Decision Makingâ€™. Teachers should be familiar with the relevant key knowledge and key skills related to the specific outcome being assessed in order to plan an assessment task. It should be noted that it is usually not feasible, nor expected, to assess every key knowledge and key skill dot point, nor should the task focus on too narrow a range of key knowledge and key skills. Aim to assess a representative sample of key knowledge and key skills listed within the area of study. The study design identifies a range of task types that could be used and the study advice provides detailed examples of sample tasks. Step 2: Refer to the assessment advice The performance descriptors in the study advice give a clear indication of the qualities and characteristics that should be apparent in a student response at each level of achievement. Teachers may select from a range of specified assessment tasks. Note: there is a requirement that at least 30 marks of the 100-mark weighting of School assessed Coursework for Unit 4 be allocated to ICT-based assessment. Step 3: Determine teaching and learning activities Unpack the performance descriptors , these provide a clear indication of qualities, characteristics and level of detail sought in a student response at each level. The teaching and learning activities should be designed to develop, maintain and extend student proficiency in all key knowledge and key skills. Relate the key knowledge and key skills to the specific content to be taught. Include activities designed to elicit studentsâ€™ understanding and use of key knowledge and key skills for this outcome. Teachers may consider using a range of task types as part of the teaching and learning activities. Both key knowledge and key skills, as specified in the area of study, must be addressed, presented and practised in class in order to prepare students comprehensively. For example, in Unit 4 Area of Study 2, the teacher should focus on learning activities that will build student knowledge and skills so an ability to do the following is demonstrated; to use applicable accounting terminology to explain and apply relevant qualitative characteristics and accounting assumptions to apply theoretical knowledge to simulated situations to manually prepare classified budgeted accounting reports and variance reports to use ICT, including spreadsheets, to prepare and analyse classified budgeted accounting reports and variance reports, and construct graphical representations to model and analyse the financial effects of alternative strategies to improve business performance to analyse and interpret classified historical, budgeted and variance reports, graphical representations and other information to evaluate the performance of a business to discuss strategies to improve the performance of a business to discuss and evaluate ethical considerations in relation to business decision-making and the strategies used to improve business performance. Step 4: Design the assessment task It is recommended that assessment tasks be completed in class under supervision and within a limited time frame. The overall assessment program for the unit should include a variety of assessment task types, include appropriate provision to authenticate of student work and take into account overall student workload. Schools may determine the conditions for each task. Students should be advised of the timeline and conditions under which the task is to be completed beforehand. The assessment task must directly assess student understanding and ability to apply the relevant key knowledge and key skills, and hence demonstrate achievement of the outcome to be assessed. Clear instructions should be given regarding the requirements of the task within a reasonable time period beforehand, including criteria, time allocation and format. The task should be unambiguous, and the requirements for the responses should be explicitly stated. The School-assessed Coursework task for Unit 4 Area of Study 2 should be completed at the end of teaching of Area of Study 2, to ensure that students have been exposed to, and had ample opportunity to develop an understanding of and ability to apply, the specified key knowledge and key skills. The exact dates and times for assessment to take place is a school-based decision. This may be determined after consultation with students, VCE coordinators and other key staff. The School-assessed Coursework task for Unit 4 Area of Study 2 is worth 50 marks of the 100 marks available for internal assessment for Unit 4. This outcome lends itself well to be used as an ICT task. It should be completed at the end of Area of Study 2 to ensure that students have been exposed, to and had the opportunity to grasp, the specified key knowledge and key skills. The marking scheme used to assess a studentâ€™s level of performance should reflect the relevant performance descriptors and be explained to students before they commence the task. One approach to constructing the assessment task: Unit 4 Outcome 2 Construct a brief case study where students are presented with financial data relating to the preparation of budgeted accounting reports and variance reports for a trading business. Financial information and other related information should be incorporated. Design questions where students are required to model, analyse and discuss the effect of alternative strategies on the performance of the business. Specific key knowledge and key skills relevant to Unit 4 Area of Study 2 must be directly assessed. Questions must directly assess studentsâ€™ level of understanding and ability to apply the relevant key knowledge and key skills. Studentsâ€™ understanding of relevant ethical considerations should also be assessed. Sources such as commercially produced School-assessed Coursework materials, financial reports and data, textbooks and the media can all be used as stimulus when designing a SAC assessment and developing questions. These materials must however be adapted and modified to ensure that the SAC task created is unique to the school within the specific academic year. Ensure that questions developed specifically address and assess studentsâ€™ understanding and grasp of the key knowledge and key skills relevant to the Area of Study and Outcome. This task is worth 50 marks towards the total of 100 marks allocated to School-assessed Coursework for Unit 4. Note that the VCE Accounting Study Design stipulates that at least 30 marks must be allocated to ICT-based assessment in Unit 4. The teacher will decide the most appropriate time to deliver this task and must inform the students ahead of the decided date. This decision will involve considerations including: the estimated time it will take to teach the key knowledge and skills for the outcome the likely length of time required for students to complete the task when and which SAC tasks being delivered in other subjects and resulting student workload implications."
