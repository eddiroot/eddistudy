    const description = `Structured questions â€“ General advice
The task can include data analysis and/or case study analysis within the task.
The set of questions could contain a combination of short answer (1â€“3 marks), longer response questions (4â€“6 marks) and an extended response question (10â€“12 marks).
Questions could include reference to data, stimulus, or short case studies as appropriate. The questions should direct students to refer to any stimulus material provided.
Longer response and extended response questions should be structured to ensure an entry point is possible for all students while providing the opportunity for higher marks to be awarded for higher performance (rather than a series of discrete lower order questions).
Questions of 6 or more marks should be marked holistically using a rubric.
Teachers can set multiple questions based on the same stimulus, with each part likely increasing in complexity. Teachers should minimise consequential questions where the answer to one question depends on a correct answer to a previous question.

Preparing for the task

As this example is for Unit 3 Outcome 2, the selection of a structured questions task is dependent upon this task type not being used in Unit 3 Outcome 1.
Given that this outcome is worth 50 marks out of the 100 marks available for School-assessed Coursework in Unit 3, it may be appropriate to have students complete only one task or to split the assessment of the outcome over two tasks. If splitting the task, teachers can either use the same task type or a different task type for the second task (provided this was not used in Unit 3 Outcome 1).
Commercially produced tasks and publicly available material could be used as practice material in preparation for the task. These materials are not to be used in the development of the task without significant modification that ensures their uniqueness.
Identify the assessment tool. A mark guide (scheme) should be used to assess this task, with inbuilt rubrics for longer and extended response questions. This assessment tool should be prepared alongside the task.
Identify the nature and sequence of teaching and learning activities used to cover the key knowledge and key skills outlined in this area of study. The teaching and learning activities included in the support materials for Unit 3 Outcome 2 account for different learning styles and will allow students to build and consolidate their knowledge and skills.

Designing the task

Refer to the outcome statement on page 24 of the study design.
Look carefully at Outcome 2 and the key knowledge and key skills relevant to this statement. The introductory statement to the unit and area of study and the relevant performance descriptor will also provide a clear guide as to the qualities and characteristics of performance for this task.
All or some of the assessable Unit 3 Area of Study 2 key knowledge and key skills on pages 24 and 25 could be assessed in this task.
After considering the key knowledge and key skills that are being assessed, the teacher must set questions that require and allow the student to demonstrate the required level of performance, as well as provide good coverage of the content.
When setting questions, ensure consistent language from the study design outcome, key knowledge and key skills is applied. In addition, give careful consideration to command terms used in questions to ensure they meet the requirements of the outcome.

Examples of possible command terms for Health and Human Development:

Lower order	Medium order	Higher order
Identify
Outline
State
Compare
Describe
Explain* (can be Medium or High)
Analyse
Discuss
Draw conclusions
Evaluate
Explain*
Justify

It is suggested that a range of question types are included, bearing in mind the:
complexity and difficulty of the key knowledge and key skills
command term used in the relevant key skill is the highest level of expected performance. For example, a skill that requires students to describe a concept, a question can be set at a lower level of performance (i.e outline), but not a higher level of performance (i.e. evaluate)
volume of key knowledge to be considered or included within the response.
A rule of thumb would be to prepare 25% lower order questions, 50% medium order questions and 25% higher order questions. This will allow for a spread of marks and a ranking of students to occur while meeting the outcome.
Allocated marks for each question must be clear and the marks allocated should reflect the degree of difficulty or complexity required by task words. Teachers are encouraged to consider the expected answer when allocating marks to ensure the mark allocation matches the command term.

Delivering the task

Decide on the conditions under which the task will be conducted and include this in instructions to students. The school-assessed coursework conditions may be influenced by school requirements.
An example of school-assessed coursework conditions includes:

Closed book, examination conditions: no notes or textbooks permitted and students to be supervised while undertaking the assessment.
Timing: 60 minutes to complete the task. This allows for 10 minutes of reading time, then 50 minutes to complete the written responses to structured questions. This will be influenced by your school and student needs.

Assessing the task

Mark the task, rank student performance and provide feedback.
The Unit 3 Outcome 2 performance descriptor provides a useful guide for ensuring the mark guide (scheme) assesses all levels of student performance and therefore validates the appropriateness of the mark guide.`;

    const title = 'extended response';
    
    const description = `Extended response â€“ General advice

This task requires students to annotate a range of stimuli to synthesise key ideas and to develop a detailed plan based on the components of the question and stimulus material provided by the teacher.

Preparing for the task

As this example is for Unit 4 Outcome 2, the selection of an extended response task is dependent upon this task type not being used in Unit 4 Outcome 1.
Given that this outcome is worth 50 marks out of the 100 marks available for School-assessed Coursework in Unit 4, it may be appropriate to have students complete only one task or to split the assessment of the outcome over two tasks. If splitting the task, teachers can either use the same task type or a different task type for the second task (provided this was not used in Unit 4 Outcome 1).
Identify the assessment tool. A rubric should be used to assess this task. The Unit 4 Area of Study 2 performance descriptor is an appropriate starting point in designing an assessment tool for this task; however, this requires modification to ensure it meets the needs of the task.
Identify the nature and sequence of teaching and learning activities used to cover the key knowledge and key skills outlined in this area of study. The teaching and learning activities included in the support materials for Unit 3 Outcome 2 account for different learning styles and will allow students to build and consolidate their knowledge and skills.

Designing the task

The teacher needs to set a question that provides good coverage of the outcome and allows students to demonstrate the highest level of performance and the qualities and characteristics that define this. To do this, refer to the outcome statement on page 28 of the study design.
Look carefully at Outcome 2 and the key knowledge and key skills relevant to this statement. The introductory statement to the unit and area of study and the relevant performance descriptor will also provide a clear guide as to the qualities and characteristics of performance for this task.
All or some of the assessable Unit 4 Area of Study 2 key knowledge and key skills on pages 28 and 29 could be assessed in this task.
After considering the key knowledge and key skills that are being assessed, the teacher needs to source and select two or three stimuli that students will use in their response. The stimuli selected should have strong links to the outcome being assessed and allow students to apply their understanding of the key knowledge and to demonstrate the key skills. The stimuli should include a variety of types such as:
data (tables or graphs or text-based data) related to a key feature of an SDG or an aspect of health and/or human development
an infographic outlining the key features of an SDG
a case study, of an aid program addressing an SDG or a WHO priority
a photograph, linked to an SDG.
Students are to be provided with time to plan their response. During this time students should be encouraged to annotate the stimulus material and plann the components of their response.
To complete the planning element, students could develop their own hardcopy mind map or use mind mapping software such as SmartDraw, Prezi, MindManager, Mind42

Delivering the task

Decide on the conditions under which the task will be conducted and include this in instructions to students. A suggested time allocation for this task could be:
30â€“40 minutes annotating and planning
20â€“30 minutes writing the response.

Assessing the task

Use the rubric to assess the planning tool and the extended written response. Mark allocation should be prioritised towards the extended response.
Mark the task, rank student performance and provide feedback.`;
