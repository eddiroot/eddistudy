Given that the graph of y = g(x) passes through the origin, find the coordinates of Q in terms of m.\nAnswer: Method 1: Using derivative in terms of k. g'(x) = g'(0). (1/3)(x-k)^(-2/3) = (1/3)(-k)^(-2/3). (x-k)^(-2/3) = (-k)^(-2/3). (x-k)^(-2) = (-k)^(-2). (x-k)^2 = (-k)^2. x-k = \u00b1k. x = 0 or x = 2k. Then find y value as above. Q: (2m^3, 2m). Or in terms of m: g'(x) = 1/(3(x-k)^(2/3)) = 1/(3(x-m^3)^(2/3)). g'(0) = 1/(3k^(2/3)) = 1/(3m^2). Therefore 1/(3(x-m^3)^(2/3)) = 1/(3m^2). Therefore (x-m^3)^(1/3) = m. x-m^3 = m^3. x = 2m^3. g(2m^3) = (2m^3 - m^3)^(1/3) + m = (m^3)^(1/3) + m = m + m = 2m. Therefore the required coordinates of Q is (2m^3, 2m). Method 2: using symmetry of graph of g(x). Graph shows point of inflection at (m^3, m) and point Q at (2m^3, 2m). Method 3: Using inverse. Inverse is g^(-1)(x) = (x-m)^3 + k. This has a point of inflection at (m,k). The inverse must also pass through the origin. By symmetry, the gradient at the origin is equal to the gradient at x = 2m. g^(-1)(2m) = (2m-m)^3 + k = m^3 + k = 2m^3. Then swap x and y values to get the coordinates of Q as (2m^3, 2m). Method 4: Symmetry of graph of g'(x). Graph shows gradient function is symmetrical about the line x = k. So Q must be at x = 2k. g(2k) = (2k-k)^(1/3) + m = k^(1/3) + m = (m^3)^(1/3) + m = 2m. Q(2m^3, 2m). Marking: 1M - evidence of equating their derivatives and attempting to solve for 'x'. 1M - get x = 2k or in terms of m and see attempt to substitute to find g(2k). 1A accept x = 2m^3, y = 2m. 1M for sketching graph and noting point of inflection coordinates of (m^3, m). 1M for x = 2m^3 and evidence of using symmetry to find g(2m^3). 1A accept x = 2m^3, y = 2m. 1M - state inverse and point of inflection. 1M - state x = 2m and attempt to find g^(-1)(2m). 1A accept x = 2m^3, y = 2m. 1M - statement of symmetry. 1M - get x = 2k (or in terms of m) and see attempt to substitute to find g(2k). 1A.",
