Their purpose is almost always to persuade you to vote for them or support a policy. In contrast, a news report aims to inform you about current events, and a stand-up comedian's routine is designed to entertain you. While these purposes can sometimes overlap (a persuasive speech might use humour to engage, or present facts to support an argument), the dominant intent guides the author's choices.</p>"

Arguments that align with an audience's values are far more likely to be accepted.</li><li><strong>Prior Knowledge and Experience:</strong> What does the audience already know about the topic? Does the author need to provide extensive background information, or can they assume a certain level of understanding? Avoiding jargon for a general audience or using technical terms for experts are examples of adapting to prior knowledge.</li></ul><p><strong>Visualise this:</strong> An author is like a chameleon, constantly adapting their message (changing their colours) to perfectly blend with the specific characteristics of their audience (the environment).

This is the core of our focus.</li><li><strong>To Inform:</strong> To present facts, data, or explanations to enhance an audience's knowledge without necessarily advocating for a particular viewpoint.</li><li><strong>To Entertain:</strong> To amuse, engage, or provide enjoyment, often through storytelling or humour.</li></ul><p>Think about a politician giving a speech. Their purpose is almost always to persuade you to vote for them or support a policy.

If an author's argument is that climate change is an urgent crisis, an urgent and alarmist tone will amplify that message. Conversely, a dismissive tone towards an opposing viewpoint can undermine its perceived validity without directly refuting it.</li><li><b>Positioning the Audience:</b> Tone is highly effective in manipulating an audience's emotional and intellectual response. An empathetic tone might position the audience to feel sympathy or solidarity, making them more receptive to calls for humanitarian aid. A sarcastic or cynical tone might position the audience to share the author's disdain for a particular group or policy, fostering agreement through shared scorn. An objective tone might position the audience to view the author as a reliable, unbiased source, making them more likely to accept the presented facts.</li></ul><br>Consider a political speech: a politician might adopt a hopeful, optimistic tone when discussing their vision for the future to inspire voters, but then switch to an urgent, critical tone when describing the problems caused by their opponents, positioning the audience to feel alarmed and therefore more likely to support change."

If an author's argument is that climate change is an urgent crisis, an urgent and alarmist tone will amplify that message. Conversely, a dismissive tone towards an opposing viewpoint can undermine its perceived validity without directly refuting it.</li><li><b>Positioning the Audience:</b> Tone is highly effective in manipulating an audience's emotional and intellectual response. An empathetic tone might position the audience to feel sympathy or solidarity, making them more receptive to calls for humanitarian aid. A sarcastic or cynical tone might position the audience to share the author's disdain for a particular group or policy, fostering agreement through shared scorn. An objective tone might position the audience to view the author as a reliable, unbiased source, making them more likely to accept the presented facts.</li></ul><br>Consider a political speech: a politician might adopt a hopeful, optimistic tone when discussing their vision for the future to inspire voters, but then switch to an urgent, critical tone when describing the problems caused by their opponents, positioning the audience to feel alarmed and therefore more likely to support change."

Students read, view and/or listen to a variety of texts from the media, including print and digital, and audio and audio visual, and develop their understanding of the ways in which arguments and language complement one another to position an intended audience in relation to a selected issue. Students consider the purpose, audience and context of each text, the arguments, and the ways written and spoken language, and visuals are employed for effect. They analyse the ways all these elements work together to influence and/or convince an intended audience. Consideration and time should be given to explicit teaching of the contextual and cultural background of the selected issue and the texts explored. Students must explore and analyse the structures and features of argument presented in audio and/or audio visual texts, and consider the unique structures and features that enhance argument in these contexts. They plan and develop written analyses in response to their explorations. Students practise the skills of revision and editing for clarity and coherence. Students apply their understanding of the use of argument and language to create a point of view text for oral presentation. Through active listening, reading and viewing, students monitor and evaluate arguments on a topic of their choice, and then plan and develop their own point of view text on that topic. They present their points of view as a discussion, dialogue or debate, or in a presentation mode that best suits their context, purpose and audience.

Through the prism of a contemporary and substantial local and/or national issue, students read, view and listen to a range of texts that attempt to position an intended audience in a particular context. They explore the structure of these texts, including contention, sequence of arguments, use of supporting evidence and persuasive strategies. They closely examine the language and the visuals employed by the author, and offer analysis of the intended effect on the audience. Students apply their knowledge of argument to create a point of view text for oral presentation. Suitable texts for study should reflect a variety of persuasive texts. Appropriate texts could be drawn from print, digital, audio and audio visual sources. These texts may include speeches, digitally presented texts, opinion and comment pieces, and other texts designed to position audiences in relation to an issue. In selecting these texts, teachers should reflect on what students choose to read, view and listen to. Consideration and time should be given to the explicit teaching of contextual information and cultural knowledge required to support an understanding of the selected issue and texts. Students practise analysing persuasive texts using note taking, summaries and short-answer questions, and through formal, analytical writing. When working with audio or audio visual texts, they explore elements of spoken language including intonation, volume, pace, pausing and stress, and develop analysis of the ways these elements contribute to argument and the effect on the audience. Students craft their writing using evidence from the texts to support their analysis. They draft and revise their writing and invite feedback from their teacher and other students to refine their ideas and expression. They aim for coherence, logic and accuracy in their writing. Students employ their understanding of argument to create their own point of view text. They construct this text for oral presentation, and learn about the conventions of oral presentation for persuasive purposes.",
