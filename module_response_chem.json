This is usually straightforward, often just ensuring one of each element appears on both sides.<br/><br/><b>Step 2: Balance oxygen (O) atoms by adding H\u2082O molecules.</b><br/>For every oxygen atom that is 'missing' on one side, add one H\u2082O molecule to that side. Remember, H\u2082O is abundant in aqueous solutions.<br/><br/><b>Step 3: Balance hydrogen (H) atoms by adding H\u207a ions.</b><br/>Now that you've added H\u2082O, you've likely introduced hydrogen atoms. Balance these by adding H\u207a ions to the side that needs them. Since we are in acidic conditions, H\u207a ions are readily available.<br/><br/><b>Step 4: Balance the overall charge by adding electrons (e\u207b).</b><br/>This is the crucial step for identifying the half-equation as oxidation or reduction. Calculate the total charge on both sides of the equation. Add electrons (which carry a -1 charge) to the more positive side to make the charges equal. If electrons are on the product side (lost), it's oxidation. If electrons are on the reactant side (gained), it's reduction."

Think of them as a checklist to guarantee accuracy:<br/><br/><b>Step 1: Balance all atoms EXCEPT oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H).</b><br/>Focus on the 'main' atoms first. This is usually straightforward, often just ensuring one of each element appears on both sides.<br/><br/><b>Step 2: Balance oxygen (O) atoms by adding H\u2082O molecules.</b><br/>For every oxygen atom that is 'missing' on one side, add one H\u2082O molecule to that side. Remember, H\u2082O is abundant in aqueous solutions.<br/><br/><b>Step 3: Balance hydrogen (H) atoms by adding H\u207a ions.</b><br/>Now that you've added H\u2082O, you've likely introduced hydrogen atoms. Balance these by adding H\u207a ions to the side that needs them. Since we are in acidic conditions, H\u207a ions are readily available.<br/><br/><b>Step 4: Balance the overall charge by adding electrons (e\u207b).</b><br/>This is the crucial step for identifying the half-equation as oxidation or reduction. Calculate the total charge on both sides of the equation. Add electrons (which carry a -1 charge) to the more positive side to make the charges equal. If electrons are on the product side (lost), it's oxidation. If electrons are on the reactant side (gained), it's reduction."

Students develop their skills in the use of scientific equipment and apparatus. They investigate reaction rates including the measurement of mass, gas volumes and time. They use an equilibrium system, such as iron(III) thiocyanate, to predict and test the effect of different changes to the system. They investigate the effect of catalysts on reaction rates, such as comparing the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using organic and inorganic catalysts. Students explore the application of electrolysis in the manufacture of useful products through experiments such as electroplating and anodising.

All galvanic cells transform chemical energy to electrical energy. Therefore, when operating, a galvanic cell's stored chemical energy will decrease as it produces electrical energy.

Exothermic metal displacement reactions can be used to drive galvanic cells, in which the energy released in the reaction is in the form of electrical energy instead of heat energy. Students should record a justified prediction of the metal displacement reactions in their logbooks prior to undertaking the experimental investigation.The temperature rise that occurs in metal displacement reactions, which is directly proportional to the heat energy released, is determined by using a temperature probe. The voltage across the galvanic cells driven by those reactions is measured using a voltmeter connected in parallel with each cell. The voltage is directly proportional to the electrical energy delivered by the cell per second by the relationship. Required: relevant glassware, equipment and materials including a voltmeter; a globe; electrical wiring; a temperature probe; strips of zinc, copper, iron and tin; strips of filter paper and solutions of 1.0 M ZnCl2, 1.0 M CuCl2, 1.0 M FeCl2, 1.0 M SnCl2 and 0.1 M NaCl (for salt bridges). Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant science skills embedded in the task.Health and safety notesStudents must:dispose of metal strips and metal solutions in properly labelled waste containers and not down sinks wash their hands after handling the chemicals. MethodStudents place a metal strip in a test tube with a temperature probe, add 20 mL of a 1.0 M solution of one of the test metals, and measure and record the temperature rise that occurs over 5 minutes. They also record their observations of any reaction that they observe over that time. This is repeated for a range of combinations of metals and metal solutions and the results compared with their predictions using the electrochemical series. Students set up galvanic cells, each using one of the metal displacement reactions that are identified as exothermic, and place the same globe across the two electrodes. They measure and record the voltage across each cell. Discussion questions and report writing in logbookStudents complete a results table showing the temperature rise and voltage for each metal combination. They then draw a scatterplot graph of voltage against temperature rise from all the data points to test if there is a relationship between the temperature rise and the voltage.Questions should focus on identification of the dependent and independent variables, controlled variables, sources of error and the validity of this experimental method and how it could be improved.Teacher notesThis is a systematic procedure producing quantitative and qualitative data. Students should be aware that the experiment is not being conducted at standard conditions, as the temperature is not being held constant at 25 oC, and the metal strips are not made from the pure metal. Extensions to this activity may involve students testing other metals, or processing the class results, to create more data points for the scatterplot graph.",

Reactants and products in chemical reactions are treated qualitatively through the application of Le Chatelier\u2019s principle and quantified using equilibrium expressions, reaction quotients and Faraday\u2019s Laws. Students explore the sustainability of different options for producing useful materials for society. The selection of learning contexts should allow students to develop practical techniques to investigate equilibrium and electrolysis. Students develop their skills in the use of scientific equipment and apparatus. They investigate reaction rates including the measurement of mass, gas volumes and time. They use an equilibrium system, such as iron(III) thiocyanate, to predict and test the effect of different changes to the system. They investigate the effect of catalysts on reaction rates, such as comparing the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using organic and inorganic catalysts. Students explore the application of electrolysis in the manufacture of useful products through experiments such as electroplating and anodising. They model and explain the operation of secondary cells: for example, those in portable devices such as laptops or cell phones. Students respond to challenges such as predicting and testing the optimum conditions under which a selected reaction can produce the highest product yield.",
