      "task": "Demonstrate effective writing skills by producing their own texts, designed to respond to a specific context and audience to achieve a stated purpose; and to explain their decisions made through writing processes. This sample approach focuses on the first part of the outcome. Step 1: Define the parameters of the outcome and the related assessment task options Read the outcome and key knowledge and skills for Unit 3 Area of Study 2: Creating texts carefully and consider what evidence could be gathered to demonstrate student learning. It should be noted that each key knowledge and skill does not need to be individually identifiable in the task nor should the task focus on too narrow a range of key knowledge and skills. Step 2: Examine the assessment advice in this handbook Unpack the performance descriptors as they provide a clear indication of qualities and characteristics that you are looking for in a student response. For example, a written text for this outcome would need to demonstrate the ability to generate and use ideas, employ voices appropriate to purpose, context and audience, experiment with and extend vocabulary and draft, refine and complete individual writing. Step 3: Design the assessment task The requirements of the task will be determined by the selected idea from the Framework of Ideas and the selected mentor texts. The following is an example of an assessment task based on the idea ‘Writing about play’. Writing about play Drawing on the writing you have drafted, explored and completed over this unit of work, create a written text that explicitly incorporates one of the items of stimulus (below), for an audience of your peers in a public context. The purpose of the written text is to be determined by you. Stimulus 1 “Play is, by definition, a safety space. If a designer or artist can make safe spaces that allow the negotiation of real-world concepts, issues, and ideas, then a game can be successful in facilitating the exploration of innovative solutions for apparently intractable problems.” – Mary Flanagan, Critical Play: Radical Game Design Stimulus 2 “According to the pianist and essayist Stephen Nachmanovitch, play is sometimes conceived as a threat to normativity precisely because it wastes time. A game of amateur soccer or netball is measurably productive: it is good for our physical health, it develops teamwork skills. Similarly positive outcomes can be matched to more intellectual games like chess or cryptic crosswords. But if we devote too much time to this kind of play at the expense of family or work duties, we open ourselves up to criticism. I wonder about this, and about the double-edged nature of my radically altered state since play became such a large part of my everyday life. 'Play is not the way to maintain a tightly controlled society,' writes Nachmanovitch, 'or a clear definition of what is good, true or beautiful.' No, it isn't. And that's what makes it so delightful. That's what makes me want to defend it.” Julienne van Loon, ‘The play of days’, Stimulus 3 “I went to great lengths in that environment to hide my sexuality while I was playing footy, I didn't want any of them to figure it out. And what that looks like to give you an idea was I would second guess everything that I said or did — I wouldn't get involved in conversations about relationships or what I was doing on the weekend out of fear that they might figure it out. And I even went to the extent of creating a separate Facebook list, so that just my teammates wouldn't see photos I was tagged in, places I was checked into or what my relationship status was. And it probably limited the kinds of friendships and bonds that I could have developed with my teammates growing up. Cause I was always hiding a big part of my life.” Jason Ball, ‘I Played Better, Step 4: Determining teaching and learning activities For Unit 3 Outcome 2, the teacher plans a sequence of teaching and learning activities that will enable students to develop knowledge and skills. This will include opportunities to plan, explore, draft, revise and complete written texts See Teaching and learning for additional activities that could support students to prepare for this assessment. Other considerations When to assess the students The teacher must decide the most appropriate time to set this task. This decision is the result of several considerations including: the estimated time it will take to cover the key knowledge and skills for the outcome when tasks are being conducted in other subjects and the workload implications for students where there are multiple classes in English/EAL, a common School-assessed Coursework scheduling is advisable. Marking the task The marking scheme used to assess a student's level of performance should reflect the relevant aspects of the Performance descriptors and be explained to students before starting the task."
