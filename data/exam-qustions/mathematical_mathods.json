    "question": "Consider the simultaneous linear equations\n3k x – 2y = k + 4\n(k – 4)x + ky = –k\nwhere x, y ∈ R and k is a real constant.\nDetermine the value of k for which the system of equations has no real solution.",
    "answer": "Method 1: Using ratios, we require that (3k)/(k-4) = -2/k and (-2)/k ≠ (k+4)/-k (otherwise resulting in infinite solutions). Solve the first quadratic equation: (3k)/(k-4) = -2/k ⇒ 3k^2 = -2(k-4) ⇒ 3k^2 + 2k - 8 = 0 ⇒ (3k-4)(k+2) = 0 ⇒ k = 4/3 or k = -2. Check the second equation or otherwise: 2k ≠ k^2 + 4k ⇒ k^2 + 2k ≠ 0 ⇒ k(k+2) ≠ 0 ⇒ k ≠ 0, k ≠ -2. Hence, for the system to have no solution, k = 4/3 only. \n\nMethod 2: Using Matrices, we form the determinant and set equal to zero:\n| 3k  -2  |   | x |   = | k+4 |\n| k-4  k  |   | y |     | -k  |\nThe determinant is det A = 3k^2 + 2(k-4) = 3k^2 + 2k - 8 = 0 ⇒ (3k-4)(k+2) = 0 ⇒ k = 4/3 or k = -2. Then check solutions to find k = 4/3 for no solution.\n\nMethod 3: Using gradients, we require same gradient, but different y intercept. y1 = (3k/2)x - (k+4)/2, y2 = -((k-4)/k)x - 1. Set gradients equal: 3k/2 = -((k-4)/k) ⇒ 3k^2 = -2(k-4) ⇒ 3k^2 + 2k - 8 = 0 ⇒ (3k-4)(k+2) = 0 ⇒ k = 4/3 or k = -2. Then check y-intercept: (k+4)/2 ≠ 1 ⇒ k+4 ≠ 2 ⇒ k ≠ -2. So k = 4/3.\n\nMethod 4: Setting equations equal to each other. y1 = (3k/2)x - (k+4)/2, y2 = -((k-4)/k)x - 1. Set equal: (3k/2)x - (k+4)/2 = -((k-4)/k)x - 1. Rearranging gives: 3k^2 x/2 + 2(k-4)x = k(k+4) - 2k ⇒ x(3k^2 + 2k - 8) = k^2 + 2k ⇒ x(k+2)(3k-4) = k(k+2). For k = -2 gives infinite solutions, k = 4/3 gives no solutions.\n\nMarking: 1M – attempt to use any of multiple methods: equate a ratio pair, gradient/intercept method, matrices, equate y1=y2. 1M – produce correct quadratic and attempt to solve/factorise the quadratic. 1A – reason not required. Final answer: k = 4/3 only.",

Inverse is g^(-1)(x) = (x-m)^3 + k. This has a point of inflection at (m,k). The inverse must also pass through the origin. By symmetry, the gradient at the origin is equal to the gradient at x = 2m. g^(-1)(2m) = (2m-m)^3 + k = m^3 + k = 2m^3. Then swap x and y values to get the coordinates of Q as (2m^3, 2m).
