    "question": "Jenny and Kwan are discussing how the International Space Station (ISS) supply-craft missions operate. The station is resupplied with food, water, air, fuel, scientific equipment and other necessities every three months. Kwan suggests that the supply craft could initially be put into a circular orbit relative to the ISS, as shown in Figure 8, before it eventually docks. Figure 8 shows a circular dotted orbit around the ISS (at center) with radius r = 500 m, and a supply craft positioned on the orbit with velocity v = 0.436 m s⁻¹. The centripetal force needed to keep the supply craft in orbit, Kwan argues, is provided by the gravitational attraction between the supply craft and the ISS. Kwan calculates that an orbital radius of 500 m could be achieved with the supply craft travelling at a speed of 0.436 m s⁻¹. The mass of ISS is 4.50 × 10⁵ kg, and the mass of the supply craft is 1.50 × 10⁴ kg. Will Kwan's suggestion work? Justify your answer with appropriate calculations.",

If Nicola had carried out the investigation using a photocell with a plate made from a different metal, explain what effect, if any, this would have had on the graph. Consider how the slope and intercepts might change.",
    "answer": "The graph would move up/down/left/right while maintaining the same gradient. The slope (related to Planck's constant) remains the same, but both intercepts would change because different metals have different work functions.",

    "question": "In carrying out her photoelectric effect investigation, Nicola initially used a green filter and produced a graph of photocurrent (I) versus voltage (V) as shown in Figure 23. [Figure 23 shows a graph with photocurrent I (mA) on the y-axis and voltage V (volts) on the x-axis. The curve starts at point P on the negative voltage axis (around -1V), curves upward crossing the voltage axis at the origin, passes through point N on the positive current axis (around +0.5 mA), and then levels off horizontally at point M, creating a plateau at maximum current.] She then replaced the green filter with a blue filter, keeping the light output power of the blue light at the photocell exactly the same as the light output power of the green light. Will the position of P, as shown on the graph in Figure 23, move to the left, remain the same, or move to the right? Justify your answer. No calculations or numerical values are required.",
    "answer": "The position of P will move to the left. Blue light has higher frequency than green light. According to the photoelectric equation E = hf - φ, higher frequency photons impart more energy to photoelectrons, giving them higher maximum kinetic energy. Since eVstop = KEmax, higher maximum kinetic energy requires a larger stopping voltage. Point P represents the stopping voltage, so it moves further left (more negative) on the voltage axis.",

No calculations or numerical values are required.",
    "answer": "The horizontal line NM (photocurrent) will be lower. When power remains constant but wavelength changes to blue (higher frequency), there are fewer photons reaching the metal plate. Since P = Nhf, keeping power constant while increasing frequency means fewer photons per second. Fewer photons result in fewer photoelectrons being emitted, so the photocurrent (proportional to photoelectrons per second) decreases.",

Your response should explain: • why the wave model does not satisfactorily explain this feature • how the particle-like nature of light does explain this feature.",
    "answer": "The existence of a threshold frequency below which no photoelectrons are emitted, regardless of light intensity. Wave model: Predicts that increasing intensity should eventually provide enough energy to emit photoelectrons at any frequency, so no threshold should exist. Experimental results: Below a certain threshold frequency, no photoelectrons are emitted regardless of intensity. Particle model explanation: Each photon carries energy E = hf. For photoemission, a single photon must have enough energy to overcome the work function (hf ≥ φ). If hf < φ, no single photon has sufficient energy, so increasing intensity (more low-energy photons) cannot cause photoemission.",
