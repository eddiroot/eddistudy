    "question": "Prokaryotic cells such as Escherichia coli use gene regulation to control the amount of tryptophan (trp) that is produced within the cell. One mechanism used by E. coli in gene regulation is attenuation. Attenuation prevents the A. cell from producing trp by stopping the ribosomes from attaching to the mRNA. B. production of enzymes involved in the production of trp by preventing the completion of transcription. C. RNA polymerase from transcribing genes through the binding of a repressor protein to the operator region in the operon. D. production of trp by activating the repressor protein that then detaches the ribosome from the mRNA molecule.",
    "answer": "B. In attenuation, RNA polymerase begins to transcribe the leader region of the trp operon, which lies before (upstream of) the five structural genes and, at the same time, translation of the leader region mRNA by the ribosome begins. When trp concentrations are high, the ribosome detaches from the leader region mRNA strand, transcription stops prematurely and the five structural genes encoding the five enzymes that are used to produce trp are not expressed. Attenuation occurs when the repressor protein is not bound to the operator region (i.e. when repression is not occurring).",

D. influenza D would result in major changes to the antigen, which would have little effect on the immunological memory present in seals, provided by previous infections.",
    "answer": "B. Antigenic drift refers to small gradual changes in viral surface antigens that can affect immunological memory from previous infections. Option B is correct because antigenic drift in influenza C would mean that humans may not have pre-existing immunity to the new sub-strain and so public health measures would be required to prevent an outbreak. Options A and C can be eliminated because both relate to a new strain of influenza that can infect multiple host types, which is a result of antigenic shift, not antigenic drift.",

Referring to the diagram, compare the two variable regions of the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. (2 marks)",
    "answer": "Both trastuzumab and pertuzumab have the same variable regions as they are both complementary to, and therefore bind to, the HER2 receptor. OR Trastuzumab and pertuzumab bind to the receptor at different sites. Therefore, they are complementary to different sites and have different variable regions to each other. Students were required to refer to both monoclonal antibodies in their responses.

    "question": "Measles is a highly contagious viral infection. The virus is spread when a person infected with the virus coughs or sneezes. In Australia, health authorities report cases of measles to a national body. The number of reported cases of measles from 1991 to 2002 is shown in a graph titled 'Number of reported cases of measles in Australia (1991 to 2002)'. The graph shows the number of reported cases on the y-axis (ranging from 0 to 6000) and years from 1991 to 2002 on the x-axis. The data shows approximately: 1991: ~1500 cases, 1992: ~1500 cases, 1993: ~4800 cases, 1994: ~5000 cases, 1995: ~1200 cases, 1996: ~600 cases, 1997: ~800 cases, 1998: ~400 cases, 1999: ~600 cases, 2000: ~400 cases, 2001: ~200 cases, 2002: ~200 cases. The graph shows a peak in 1993-1994 followed by a significant decline. Identify one action taken within the Australian population that may have led to the change in number of cases from 1994 onwards. Explain how this action could cause this change. (3 marks)",
    "answer": "An action taken may have been vaccination. This would have increased herd immunity by reducing the number of available hosts, thereby limiting the transmission of measles. This would have led to a decrease in the number of reported cases. Alternatively, other actions that could have been explained included the isolation/quarantine of infected individuals and increasing the education available regarding how measles infections are transmitted. These actions would have led to less transmission of measles, reducing the number of cases. Wearing masks was not accepted as an appropriate action because the measles particles can stay airborne for many hours and (surgical) masks generally have ineffective filters. Therefore, mask wearing by the general population would not have resulted in such a rapid and prolonged decrease in the number of reported cases of measles.",

    "answer": "The potential source of the measles infection could have included an infected traveller OR an unvaccinated individual contracting/spreading measles. Two benefits of listing the public locations could have included: ensuring people avoided the areas; allowing those who visited the locations to monitor for symptoms OR get tested; allowing people to isolate if they suspected they may be infected; encouraging the wearing of (hospital-grade) masks; promoting booster vaccinations.

Each of the two factors required was awarded one mark. The respective descriptions needed to match the factor identified by students to also be awarded a separate mark each. Antigenic drift was not accepted as a factor as this involves only gradual changes in the surface antigens, which most commonly results in a slight change to an existing pathogen, rather than the emergence of a new pathogen.

    "question": "Researchers studied Eucalyptus salubris in its natural habitat in Western Australia. E. salubris is an evergreen tree that reaches up to 25 metres in height. It has small, white flowers that are thought to be pollinated by insects. It also has seeds that fall directly beneath the tree canopy. The researchers sampled 20 populations of E. salubris. They noted differences in the appearance of the trees and the thickness of the leaves. The results indicated that the 20 populations could be divided into two distinct groups. Image A shows an example of one group, with thicker leaves, and Image B shows an example of the other group, with thinner leaves. The two groups live in close geographical proximity but those with thinner leaves are only found in soils with high phosphorus levels. Genetic analysis comparing the two groups showed significant differences. These findings strongly indicate that the two groups should be classified as two separate species.

Students often restated information from the stem of the question without clearly indicating the specific evidence that classified the E. salubris as separate species.

Genetic analysis comparing the two groups showed significant differences. Explain what led to the genetic diversity between the two distinct groups of trees. (4 marks)",
    "answer": "The genetic diversity between the two groups of E. salubris may have been due to: initial variation in alleles/phenotypes; the two groups being exposed to different selection pressures (e.g. different levels of phosphorus in the soil); the thinner leaf trees having a selective advantage for growing in soils with high phosphorus levels; reduced gene flow between the two groups; separate mutations accumulating in each group; reproductive isolation (as a result of flowering time / pollination). It is important that any potential misconceptions regarding genetic changes in a population over time are addressed as part of the course. Some students incorrectly included Lamarckian statements, such as suggesting the trees adapted to high phosphorus levels in the soil. Many students provided a pre-planned speciation response, whereas the question required students to discuss what led to the genetic diversity between two already separate groups/populations.

    "question": "A recent study explored variation in the DNA sequences of Indigenous Australians. Genome DNA sequencing was used to increase understanding of both human genomic diversity and genetic disease. Indigenous Australian communities were invited to take part in the genomic research. The research was conducted in accordance with required ethical guidelines to ensure that the research was beneficial to the communities and aligned with their own ways of knowing. The collection of genomic data also falls under Indigenous Australian governance and custodianship. People from four remote Indigenous communities across northern and central Australia, as well as non-Indigenous Australians, consented to take part in the research. The four remote Indigenous communities were: Tiwi Islands, Galiwin'ku, Titjikala and Yarrabah. Their locations are shown on a partial map of Australia. DNA from 121 Indigenous Australian individuals and 18 non-Indigenous Australian individuals of European ancestry was sequenced. The sequencing focused on the 0.4% of the human genome that varies among individuals. In these areas of the genome, 46% of DNA sequence variation was found within Indigenous individuals in the same community. Only 2.8% of similar DNA sequence variation was shared across all four remote Indigenous communities. It was concluded that each community has different and highly diverse DNA sequences. Similarly, each community is highly diverse in their culture and languages. The study also found that Indigenous Australians have the highest amount of DNA sequence variation outside Africa, and are highly genetically distinct from non-Indigenous Australians. The Tiwi Islands geographically separated from the Australian mainland around 9000 years ago. However, since at least 26,000 years ago, all communities have been genetically isolated, with little detectable migration. This is supported by Indigenous Australians' unique knowledges and connections to Country and Place. One of the aims of the study was to explore variation in DNA sequences of Indigenous Australians. DNA from 18 non-Indigenous Australian individuals of European ancestry was also sequenced in the study. Give one reason for this. (1 mark)",

    "question": "For their student-designed scientific investigation, a student wanted to investigate whether highlighting herd immunity in vaccination advertising campaigns influences an individual's vaccination decisions in Australia. They based their investigation on Scandinavian research that included three different groups: Group A, Group B and Group C. The student recruited 121 participants via the school newsletter and social media pages. Participants were randomly placed into each group. Individuals within each group received the following information: 'Imagine that there is a new and infectious disease in the world. The infected people have influenza symptoms, but usually recover quickly. The virus has caused a few deaths, but scientists have concerns that the virus will mutate and become more infectious. A vaccine against the virus is available, but it is not yet fully tested for side effects.' Groups B and C received additional information: Group B: 'The vaccine stimulates the body to rapidly respond to the virus, which helps to prevent illness. This is an individual benefit of vaccination.' Group C: 'Due to young age, allergies or poor health, a portion of the population cannot be vaccinated. To prevent illness in this group, it is important that the majority of the population get vaccinated. This highlights the benefit of herd immunity to the population.' After reading the information, participants were asked to answer the question 'How likely are you to get vaccinated?' Each participant rated the likelihood that they would get vaccinated by choosing one option from a 5-point scale: 1=Not likely, 2=Slightly likely, 3=Somewhat likely, 4=Likely, 5=Very likely. The results show that Group A had an average likelihood of vaccination of approximately 2.5, Group B had approximately 3.0, and Group C had approximately 3.5. Analyse the results. (3 marks)",
    "answer": "Examples of suitable analysis included: Group A reported 2.5 (slightly/somewhat likely) or the lowest likelihood of getting vaccinated; Group B reported 3 (somewhat likely) or the second highest / lower likelihood of getting vaccinated; Group C reported 3.5 (somewhat likely/likely) or the highest likelihood of getting vaccinated; Groups A and B both reported between slightly likely and somewhat likely or their average likelihood was between 2 and 3; the group that received the least amount of information was the least likely to get vaccinated; the group that received information on individual benefits had an increased likelihood of getting vaccinated; the group that received information on herd immunity had the highest likelihood of getting vaccinated; groups that received any additional information had an increased likelihood of vaccination. This question was well answered. Common incorrect responses included students not providing sufficient detail in their analysis or linking the number on the graph to an incorrect context (e.g. 3.5 does not mean 3.5 people or 3.5%, it means 3.5 average likelihood (out of 5) of getting vaccinated).",
