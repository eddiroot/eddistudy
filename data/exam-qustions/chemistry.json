    "answer": "The first mark was awarded for a clear identification of what the term 'conflict' related to in terms of the optimal rate and temperature when ammonia is being produced. A good example showing detailed understanding of this conflict could have been: Due to the exothermic nature of the equilibrium, at high temperature the rate of formation of ammonia is high but the yield will be low, whereas at low temperature the rate of formation of ammonia is too slow but the yield is very high. The second mark was awarded for a clear statement that linked the presence of the catalyst to allowing a sufficiently fast rate to be occurring at a lower temperature, and hence reducing energy requirements. The third mark was awarded for a clear statement that linked the lower temperature requirements with the green chemistry principle of 'catalysis', which states that 'Catalysts ... using less energy and reagents in reaction processes/pathways'. Therefore, a student needed to show reasoning for this choice based on linking the lower temperature to this concept.

Explain how the electrical charge in artificial photosynthesis processes is balanced given that electrons only flow in one direction.",
    "answer": "Any two of the following were valid responses: Electrons are continually generated at the anode and used up at the cathode, hence maintaining the charge balance; H⁺ ions are continually generated at the anode and flow to the cathode where they are removed, hence maintaining the charge balance; The flow of electrons to the cathode is balanced by the flow of protons to the cathode; Ions flow through the system to balance the charge. Some students attempted to show a balance by using hydroxide ions, but this was not accepted due to the clear information in the question that the reaction was occurring under acidic conditions.",

Reaction P1: Liquid ethanoic anhydride, C₄H₆O₃(l), is added to a mixture of solid 4-aminophenol, C₆H₇NO(s), and water. The resulting mixture of all reactants is heated in a hot-water bath for 10 minutes. C₆H₇NO + C₄H₆O₃ → C₈H₉NO₂ + C₂H₄O₂ (4-aminophenol, M = 109 g mol⁻¹) + (ethanoic anhydride, M = 102 g mol⁻¹) → (paracetamol, M = 151 g mol⁻¹) + (ethanoic acid, M = 60 g mol⁻¹) at 60 °C, H₂O. Reaction P2: Liquid ethanoic acid, C₂H₄O₂(l), is mixed with solid 4-aminophenol, C₆H₇NO(s). The reactant mixture is heated in a hot water bath for 10 minutes. C₆H₇NO + C₂H₄O₂ ⇌ C₈H₉NO₂ + H₂O (4-aminophenol, M = 109 g mol⁻¹) + (ethanoic acid, M = 60 g mol⁻¹) ⇌ (paracetamol, M = 151 g mol⁻¹) + (water, M = 18 g mol⁻¹) with heat. Results: For Reaction P1, the percentage yield is 87% and the percentage atom economy is 72%. For every 1.4 g of 4-aminophenol reacted in Reaction P2, 0.80 g of paracetamol is produced. Calculate the percentage yield and percentage atom economy of Reaction P2, and compare them to the results for Reaction P1.",
    "answer": "n(paracetamol) = 1.4 / 109 = 0.01284 mol and therefore m(paracetamol) = 0.01284 × 151 = 1.94 g. The first mark was awarded for the correct calculation of the % yield of reaction P2. % yield = 100 × 0.80 / 1.94 = 41%. The second mark was awarded for the correct % atom economy. % atom economy = 100 × 151 / (109 + 60) = 89%. The third mark was awarded for the comparison of % yield. The percentage yield is higher for reaction P1 with 87% compared to reaction P2, which is 41%. The fourth mark was awarded for the correct comparison. The percentage atom economy is higher for reaction P2 with 89% compared to reaction P1, which is 72%.
