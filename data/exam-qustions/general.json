The tasks must be completed sequentially and in numerical order: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, then Task 4. Management makes an initial allocation of tasks to minimise the amount of time required, but then decides that it takes the workers too long. Another worker, Edgar, is brought in to complete one of the tasks. His completion times, in hours, are: Task 1: 9, Task 2: 5, Task 3: 14, Task 4: 8. When a new allocation is made and Edgar takes over one of the tasks, the minimum total completion time compared to the initial allocation will be reduced by A. 1 hour B. 2 hours C. 3 hours D. 4 hours.",
