INVESTIGATING FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECTILE MOTION IN ATHLETICS Task Participate in and digitally record various athletics events (shot put, discus, high jump, long jump). Use the video footage to perform a qualitative analysis of the height, angle and speed of release for each of the projectiles. Instructions Data collection To ensure that all students work through each activity, divide the class into four groups and give each group a recording device (smart phone, tablet, digital camera, video camera). Students participate in each of the four events, ensuring that at least one attempt in each event is recorded. The recoding of distances thrown and/or jumped is not specifically required for the analysis; however, this data might provide further information for students to use in their evaluation. Analysis Students should have access to their own footage so they can analyse their own performance. This analysis can be done with the assistance of an app or software such as Dartfish, Hudl Technique or Coaches eye, if available. For each activity, students use annotated diagrams to: determine and show on the diagram the height of release for each event determine and show on the diagram the angle of release for each event track and draw on the diagram the flight path of the object (shot, discus, body) describe the speed of release for each of the four projectiles. Evaluation From the data, students complete the following: How does the angle of release differ between each event? Explain why, for optimal performance, the angle of release is different for each of the events performed. Discuss how a coach could use the information from the analysis to improve the performance of young athletes in athletics. Explain the importance of a straight arm at release by applying the concept of third-class levers Describe how the principle of impulse, summation of momentum and Newton’s second law of motion are applied to maximise release velocity. In the answer, make reference to the glide technique in shot put and the one and three-quarter turn discus throw technique. Explain how the height of release and the landing height affect the optimal angle of release. Discuss the following statement: ‘Release velocity is the most important determinant of flight distance of a projectile’. Conclusion Students watch the video footage of their performance in each event again. From their analysis and evaluation, and based on the principles investigated, they provide written feedback on how the movement skill can be refined or improved. For example: ‘From the analysis of the long jump, it is evident that the angle of release was too great, resulting in excess vertical speed and not enough horizontal speed, therefore decreasing the overall distance jumped. To improve long jump performance, the angle of release must be much lower than 45 degrees.’",

OXYGEN UPTAKE: AT REST, DURING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND DURING RECOVERY Task – laboratory activity Students investigate changes in oxygen uptake from rest, and during exercise and recovery, and the relative contribution from the energy systems at each of these stages. Instructions Data collection Students wear a heart rate monitor while participating in a continuous, sub-maximal activity such as running, swimming or cycling, for a minimum of 20 minutes. Heart rate data is collected at one-minute intervals while at rest (5 minutes sitting), during the activity (20 minutes continuous) and during recovery (five minutes active recovery followed by five minutes passive recovery). Tabulate data or download the file from the device. From five other people in your class, collect the time taken to reach steady state and the time taken for heart rate to return to resting levels. Analysis Students analyse their own heart rate data, if available. If the student is unable to participate in the activity, data analysis can be performed using another student’s data. To analyse the data, students: Graph heart rate versus time. Shade the periods of rest, exercise and recovery. Label periods of oxygen deficit, steady state and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Determine resting heart rate, steady state heart rate and the percentage of HR max at which this occurred. Evaluation From the data, students complete the following: Discuss the acute physiological responses to exercise. Identify periods of ‘oxygen deficit’, ‘steady state’ and ‘EPOC’. Compare the production of ATP during oxygen deficit and during steady state. Explain the role of the aerobic energy system during recovery. Explain the relationship between oxygen availability and relative contribution from each of the energy systems.

Conclusion Students write a personal reflection on their participation in the session, for example how they felt, what they enjoyed and what was difficult. Teachers should conduct the training session and then have students complete the training diary and a at the end of the session before leaving class. The training reflection from each session can then be added to the student’s reflective folio for Unit 4 documentation, as well as used for the case study assessment task in Outcome 2.",

It is not appropriate in this task to provide students with previously unseen (secondary) data to be analysed. The data may be collected individually or as a class, however, all students are to be provided with the same primary data to ensure equity in access to stimulus materials. It is important to identify that this task requires both skill acquisition and biomechanical principles to be assessed within the same task. The key skills do not have to be assessed independently of the key knowledge; they are integral to the design of the tasks. Prior to designing the assessment task, teachers should identify the appropriate assessment tool. A mark guide (scheme) should be used to assess this task and should be prepared alongside the task The performance descriptors for each outcome can be used to identify the expected level of a student response. Performance descriptors identify the qualities and characteristics that should be present in a student response and assist in the design of the task, and marking scheme.\n\nDesigning the task\n\nIn designing an assessment task, teachers should identify Unit 3 key knowledge and key skills in the VCE Physical Education Study Design , pages 23 - 26. When preparing this task, a number of factors need to be considered: Skill acquisition and biomechanical principles are to be assessed together The set of questions could contain a combination of short answer (1-3 marks), longer response questions (4 – 6 marks) and an extended response question (10-12 marks). All questions are to relate to the movement experiences completed and should require regular reference to the primary data Due to the need of responses to draw on primary data, multiple choice questions are not suitable for this task Longer response and extended response questions should be structured to ensure an entry point is possible for all students whilst providing the opportunity for higher marks to be awarded for higher performance (rather than a series of discrete lower order questions) Questions of 6 or more marks should be marked holistically using a rubric A teacher can set multiple questions based on the same stimulus, with each part likely increasing in complexity. Teachers should minimise consequential questions where the answer to one question depends on a correct answer to a previous question Allow multiple access points for students to demonstrate the highest level of knowledge and skill and be balanced overall in terms of cognitive demand. Blend key skills with questions that explore key knowledge so that the key skill is assessed in a particular context. Clearly indicate what is required of the student. The outcome asks students to analyse, develop and apply. Direct the student towards the relevant subject matter for developing their response. The question must be clear about what knowledge is being assessed. For example, identify three biomechanical principles evident in shot put. Allow for higher-order thinking through increases in cognitive demand. The use of a taxonomy (such as Bloom’s or the SOLO taxonomy) enables students to demonstrate higher-order thinking skills and allows for the assessment task to effectively discriminate between students’ performances. The VCAA glossary of command terms also provide guidance on structuring a task, as per the example below.   Examples of possible command terms for Physical Education Lower order Medium order Higher order Identify Outline State Compare Discuss Describe Explain* Analyse Design/Develop Draw conclusions Evaluate Explain* Justify\n\nDelivering the task\n\nDecide on the conditions under which the task will be conducted and include this in instructions to students. The school-assessed coursework conditions may be influenced by school requirements An example of school-assessed coursework conditions includes: Closed book, examination conditions: no notes (other than the provided primary data) or textbooks permitted and students to be supervised while undertaking the assessment. Timing: 60 minutes to complete the task. This allows for 10 minutes of reading time, then 50 minutes to complete the written responses to structured questions. This will be influenced by your school and student needs.\n\nAssessing the task\n\nMark the task, rank student performance and provide feedback The Unit 3 Outcome 1 performance descriptor provides a useful guide for ensuring the mark guide (scheme) assesses all levels of student performance and therefore validates the appropriateness of the mark guide."

This task must be completed in written report format, as outlined below (not as a set of structured questions). Considerations for conducting an activity analysis: The emphasis of the key skill related to fitness testing is on the facilitator role of the assessment of fitness. Whilst there is a need for students to participate in fitness tests so as their peers can ‘perform (field)’ and ‘observe (lab)’ the necessary facilitation of the tests, the actual participation in the test is not the focus This study design does not require students to memorise the protocols for individual tests. Instead students are to use their experience of facilitating an assessment of a range of fitness tests (see p.20 for sample fitness tests) to develop the ability to justify the selection of fitness tests for the specific physiological requirements of the activity Use the participation in fitness testing as an opportunity to reinforce the context for the use of fitness testing in Unit 4 (Training to improve performance), as a means for identifying strengths and weaknesses to design a specific training program. Do not use student participation in fitness testing to compare individual performance or results with each other in the class.\n\nDesigning the task\n\nIn designing an assessment task, teachers should identify Unit 4 key knowledge and key skills in the VCE Physical Education Study Design, pages 27 - 29. When preparing this task, a number of factors need to be considered: The activity analysis data is secondary data and needs to be pre sourced and tested to ensure it has rich opportunities for analysis and connection with the physiological requirements that underpin the activity Only provide/include data for students that is relevant for analysis (reduce the amount of information students need to synthesise. Students will only have a limited amount of time to analyse and synthesise the data and therefore it should be presented in a concise and clear format) All elements of the written report must relate to the data provided The written report should have the following structure:   An introduction that prompts students to provide a brief summary of the main findings; the main physiological requirements and the subsequent fitness tests that are appropriate. A body of the report which should provide the chance for students to unpack the main findings by providing a detailed description supported by data that justifies the physiological requirements, fitness tests and shares an understanding of how a reliable, valid and accurate assessment of fitness can be conducted A conclusion should include what was learnt through the investigation or analysis, including a summary of findings or outcomes.\n\nDelivering the task\n\nDecide on the conditions under which the task will be conducted and include this in instructions to students.

Plan out when the training sessions will be completed, allowing enough time in each session for students to complete a training log entry and discuss the training method and application of training principles The intent of delivery of the training sessions is the ‘practical is the theory and the theory is the practical’. Teachers are encouraged to be efficient in their delivery of the knowledge, skills and understanding required for completing this assessment task. A traditional classroom theoretical lesson connected to a practical training session is not the intended delivery of this aspect of the course. To appropriately contextualise the selection of training methods, teachers are encouraged to provide the specific task case study to students prior to commencing the training sessions. The focus of the training sessions is to allow students to explore the training method and reflect on this in their own individual way. The formal application of the training method experiences to the case study should only occur within the written report. Considerations for each training session (method): What training methods can be joined and be delivered through the one practical lesson. For example, flexibility training could be coupled with an aerobic type of training and short and intermediate interval training could be covered through the same session. Allocate enough time for a thorough warm up and speak about the importance of this for the individual needs of each method. ‘Less is more’ when considering the conditioning phase of the session. Consider what can be covered in appropriate detail in a session. A training log template should be provided and completed in each session. The students’ practical experiences of their participation should be recorded, as outlined in the detailed example on p.22. Each reflection of the training method undertaken should include records of each component of the training session, psychological, physiological and sociological data and referencing how the training principles were applied to the training method. Students will require access to their training log to complete the case study report, however, consideration needs to be given to how authentication will be ensured. This could include retaining the training log in between training sessions and verifying the responses that are entered and accessible for the written report.\n\nDesigning the task\n\nIn designing an assessment task, teachers should identify Unit 4 key knowledge and key skills in the VCE Physical Education Study Design , pages 27 – 29 and School – based assessment, pages 30-32.

For example, this could include; Introduction: a brief summary of the main findings, such as the aim of the training program, fitness components being trained and the training methods that will be applied Body of the report: include examples of training sessions and correct application of training principles, drawing on personal experiences during the training sessions The conclusion should summarise the training program and its aim If short answer questions are used, then all questions must require students to draw on the case study in their answers.\n\nDelivering the task\n\nDecide on the conditions under which the task will be conducted and include this in instructions to students.

For example: Option 1: a practical activity focusing on 1 movement skill, the performance of which can be compared to another individual completing the same skill. Analyse the biophysical differences in the performance of (insert movement skill) between you and a primary school student. Use the findings to compare how skill acquisition, biomechanics, energy production and training concepts interrelate in influencing the two performances. Option 2: a practical activity focusing on comparing their participation in 2 different movement skills. Analyse the biophysical differences in the performance of (insert both movement skills). Use the findings to compare how skill acquisition, biomechanical and fitness training concepts interrelate in influencing the performance of the two skills. The practical activity should be a standalone activity designed for Unit 4 Area of Study 3. The practical activity can be implemented at any stage during Unit 3 and Unit 4. However, teachers are encouraged to consider completing this task earlier in the year to allow the opportunity for students to develop theoretical knowledge and not just reinforce previously introduced concepts. The reflective folio is to be used for the collection of primary data from student participation in the practical activity and then utilised in the planning phase and completion of the extended response question. To assist with authentication, it is recommended that teachers retain the students’ reflective folio and only allow entries to be made by students during class time. To help students use their reflective folio in an effective and efficient way when completing the planning tool and the extended response question, teachers are advised to place a limit on the amount of data that students can record during the practical activity (for example, one page per theoretical concept).\n\nDesigning the task\n\nIn designing an assessment task, teachers should identify Unit 4 key knowledge and key skills in the VCE Physical Education Study Design pages 27 – 29 . When preparing this task, a number of factors need to be considered:    The following considerations should inform the design of the task: The Unit 4 Outcome 3 performance descriptor could be adapted to assess this task.   Completion of the planning tool occurs under assessment conditions and should be immediately prior to completing the extended response question As a rough guide 20 minutes should be allocated to the task of completing the planning tool. The purpose of the planning tool is for students to translate and organise their findings from the practical activity, in preparation to respond to an extended response question To achieve this, it is recommended that the scope of knowledge is kept broad for the planning phase and students are provided the opportunity to show their holistic understanding of the interrelationships that exist between skill acquisition, biomechanics, energy production and training, concepts and their impact on performance for the given practical context. The suggested inquiry question could be used to achieve this as shown below. Notes taken in the reflective folio, related directly to the practical activity completed for U4 Area of Study 3, are to be available to students in completing their planning tool The planning tool will contribute to assessment, with student performance measured through the strength of interrelationships identified The extended response question is provided to students only after completion of the planning tool The extended response question can be based around the inquiry question and then provide finer detail about the specific theoretical concepts within the discipline areas of skill acquisition, biomechanics, energy production and training, that students are required to respond on.    For example:   Inquiry question sample Extended response question Analyse the biophysical differences in the performance of (insert movement skill) between you and a primary school student. Use the findings to compare how skill acquisition, biomechanical, energy production and training concepts interrelate in influencing the two performances. Explain how the interrelationship between the following factors contributes to differences in performance of (insert movement skill) between you and a primary school student: Factor 1 (skill acquisition) Factor 2 (biomechanics) Factor 3 (energy production) Factor 4 (training) Examples of factors are specific concepts within that discipline that guide students as to where to focus their response. These factors require students to use their planning tool (broad knowledge) to now focus on the interrelationships between specific concepts within the discipline areas. For example: The 2023 VCAA VCE Physical Education exam Question 11 noted three specific factors; Newtons laws (biomechanics), fuel usage (energy production) and fitness components (training). Each of the factors provided were narrow enough for students to know what was required, but still have enough scope to show understanding in a variety of ways and between the cohort, produce a full range of performances. In assisting students to develop the capacity to effectively respond to this extended response, the following is an example of a scaffold that could be utilised:   Introduction Provide an overall comment comparing the performance of either; the two movement skills performed by the student or the same skill performed by two different individuals Body of the response Use your concept/ map to provide and explain examples of interrelationships between the factors nominated Refer to any collected data from your reflective folio to support your response Conclusion 1-2 sentences that brings the response to a close. This could include a ‘so what’ comment related to what you have found and what it means.\n\nDelivering the task\n\nDecide on the conditions under which the task will be conducted and include this in instructions to students. The school-assessed coursework conditions may be influenced by school requirements. A suggested time allocation for this task could be: 20 minutes for completion of the concept map The extended response question is immediately supplied 25-30 minutes writing time then provided to complete the written report\n\nAssessing the task\n\nMark the task, rank student performance and provide feedback The Unit 4 Outcome 3 performance descriptor could be adapted to assess this task.
