As adapted from 'Observing transpiration', 'Stomata leaf peel' and 'Preparing a leaf epidermal peel' ( GRDC , GTAC ). Aim Explore the concept of transpiration by creating a controlled environment by which this process can be monitored and measured (Part A). Compare the epidermal cellular structures (such as stomata) from the leaves of different wheat varieties. Suggest which might be best for a low rainfall environment (Part B). Key science skills Identify, inform and teach students the relevant Unit 1–4 Biology Key science skills that are embedded in the task. Introduction Most wheat cropping in Australia relies on rainfall because there is no option for irrigation or it is too expensive for larger scale farms. Australian grain growers regularly check weather updates from the Bureau of Meteorology. Farmers need the rain to fall at the right time and in the right place. Unfortunately, due largely to climate change, Australian farming areas are being plagued by periods of low rainfall, hot weather, dry winds and drought. In these conditions, plants can struggle to grow, survive and reproduce. Water movement throughout a plant is essential to its ability to grow, survive and reproduce. In a farming system, growers are keen for the plant to use every millimetre of water. From a scientific point of view, they want to offer farmers a variety that has the best adaptive traits possible. The CSIRO ( ECOS ) has found plants that, with adaptations, are higher yielding under drought conditions and better at maintaining growth. This is reflected in the fact that they keep their stomata open longer when stressed during flowering. Sensitive plants close those stomata quickly under stress and stop growing. Stomata control transpiration of water and photosynthesis and thereby regulate growth and grain production. Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water. Plants collect water from the soil through their root hairs via a process of osmosis. The water then travels up through the plant to the leaves where it is lost as the water diffuses into the surrounding air. On the outer layer of the leaf of a plant are microscopic holes called 'stomata'. Stomata control gas exchange and water loss by opening and closing. They are of particular interest to plant breeders because plants with smaller or fewer stomata tend to have lower levels of evaporation. Part A: Investigating transpiration using a controlled experiment Equipment 2 x clear measuring cylinders Square of cardboard Small cuttings of plant(s) (preferably crop plants – wheat, rye, corn, sunflower, beans, peas, radishes, lettuce, any other vegetable) Blue Tack Water Scissors Timer Pen Method Make a hole in the centre of the cardboard big enough for the stem. Put the stem of the cutting through this hole and seal the remaining space with Blue Tack. Fill one cup with water and mark the water level with a pen. Put the bottom of the cutting in the water and place the second cup over the top of the leaves of the plant. Place in the sun and observe for 20 minutes. Record your observations. Discussion questions/suggested annotations when report writing in the logbook A series of four to six graded questions that address the data and the implications of the relationship for cell survival should be set for students to answer in their logbook, for example: Identify – What are the dependent, independent and controlled variables in your investigation? Explain – What did you observe? What percentage of water was taken up by the plant? Explain the observations in terms of osmosis and transpiration. Apply – Which plants would be recommended as crops? Support your claims with evidence. Propose – What further tests could be performed to investigate transpiration rates in plants? Outline a method for a further test. Part B: Investigating stomata using a controlled experiment Investigate stomatal aperture from three different plant varieties. Procedure Stomata may be isolated and viewed under a light or digital microscope using a variety of methods, including using nail polish and sticky tape or peeling a thin epidermal layer from the leaf. Results Draw and label any points of stomata difference between the varieties and between the top and bottom of the leaf. Clearly label the stomata, guard cells and any other organelles you see. Describe the stomatal aperture, describing the appearance of guard cells. Explain why the lower epidermis of a leaf has more stomata than the upper epidermis. Which variety had the most stomata?

Teachers must consider the management logistics of the investigation, taking into account number of students, available resources and student interest. The following questions require consideration: What input would students have into the selection of the question? To what extent will all students consider the same investigation question, or complete different parts of the same question so that class data can be pooled? What input would students have into the design of the experiment? Teachers could provide students with a template that structures the investigation into a series of timed phases. Students may subsequently adapt the template as a personal work plan in their logbooks. Investigation exploration phase In this detailed example, the investigation question was generated following a class discussion about why certain vegetables and fruit become softer compared to others, relating to osmosis practical activities undertaken in Area of Study 1. Further discussion led to discussion of ways to stop vegetables and fruit becoming soft. Suggestions included keeping them in cold conditions, such as a fridge, and soaking them in water. From this discussion students formulated a question for investigation: How do environmental conditions affect osmosis in fruit or vegetables? Planning phase Students may need guidance in: fitting the investigation into the time available, and developing a work plan identifying the technical skills involved in the investigation ensuring that resources are available to meet the requirements of the investigation. Teachers should work with students to: determine to what extent students will work independently or in groups (different students or groups may investigate different vegetables or fruits or use the same vegetable and fruit and use different environmental conditions; for example, varying sucrose or salt concentrations or varying temperatures) discuss the independent, dependent and controlled variables in the experiment identify safety aspects of cutting vegetables and fruit, including use of gloves and knives, reducing contamination, use of sealed containers such as covered petri dishes or Tupperware containers for the investigation; correct disposal of fruit or vegetables in the school laboratory establish the use of standard notation and SI units and how to reference sources and provide appropriate acknowledgments. Investigation phase Prior to students undertaking scientific investigations, the teacher must approve student-designed methods. A possible general method for the experiment is as follows: Students collect and assemble equipment including data recording materials. Students cut even portions of fruit or vegetables and then place each sample into a relevant container to the investigation (other variables should be explicitly controlled). Students observe the containers and take a digital photo daily of each fruit or vegetable to record observations. Students use the photos and data to determine the effect of osmosis. The investigation should take place over at least one week. Processing phase Students consider the data collected, report on any errors or problems encountered, and use evidence to explain and answer the investigation question. Differences in osmosis can be explained in terms of the amount of water present in fruit or vegetables. Reporting phase The above phases could be recorded in the student logbook. The report of the investigation can take various forms including a written report, a scientific poster or an oral presentation of the investigation. Further investigation phase Other avenues for further investigation include: determination of the composition and amount of water in different fruits or vegetables effect of changing variables on osmosis, for example light intensity, humidity.",

Students consider an example of correlational studies, over many thousands of years, as Aboriginal people developed an intricate understanding of the environment and how different species have adapted to enhance an organism's survival and enable life to exist in a wide range of environments. Key science skills Identify, inform and teach students a selection of key science skills that are embedded in the task. Introduction The custodians of the Gariwerd region in the Grampians, including the Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung language groups, recognise six distinct weather periods in the seasonal cycle. These are genuine seasons which relate to climatic features as well as referencing reproductive strategies such as plant flowering, fruiting and animal behaviour patterns. Understanding the land through seasonal observations was essential to survival. Gariwerd National Park is home to many rare and endangered species of plants and animals, and is recognised as the single most important botanical reserve in Victoria. Today the cycles are a vital tool and contribute to the management of Gariwerd. To understand the season, we can begin to understand Gariwerd and its people. Permission to use the Gariwerd seasonal calendar and related information on the Indigenous Weather Knowledge website is given by the Elders/Directors of Gariwerd, which includes the Gunditjmara, Winda Mara (Kerrup Jamara), Goolum Goolum, Kirrae Whurrong and Framlingham peoples. Useful resources: Brambuk The National Park and Cultural Centre Gariwerd calendar Gariwerd/Grampians Procedure Consider the Gariwerd seasonal cycles in terms of observations of months of the year, depictions, weather, plants, fungi, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects and mammals in the woodland and/or wetland areas. Identify the reproductive strategies that each species uses as well as the structural, physiological and behavioural adaptations that enable them to survive in the different environments within Gariwerd National Park. Students then consider their own correlational study in their local community from a seasonal perspective, conduct planned observations of native plants and animals and record events and behaviours (that have not been manipulated or controlled to understand the relationship between variables) of local species in terms of reproductive strategies and structural, physiological and behavioural adaptation. Students decide how they will conduct the study. They may choose to record their observations and communicate their scientific ideas using an online blog (using a selected blogging website of choice such as Weebly ). Compare and contrast student and/or group and/or class observations. Discuss similarities and differences between observations. Which factors are of greater importance? Students reflect on the degree of influence of this study on their lifestyle compared to the influence of the correlational studies on the Gariwerd peoples. Discussion A series of graded questions could be set for students to answer in their logbook, for example: Compare: What are the similarities and differences between students' correlational study observations and Gariwerd peoples' observations? Explain: How do observations influence lifestyle for students' local communities and Gariwerd peoples? If there is a difference, suggest why. Evaluate: Comment on the accuracy, precision and validity of the results of the correlational studies. Reflect: Review observations and consider the contribution that Gariwerd peoples' knowledge and perspectives contribute to understandings of adaptations and interdependencies in Australian ecosystems. How is this knowledge currently utilised? Imagine future use of this knowledge. Extension Consider another Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander seasonal calendar ( Indigenous Weather Knowledge - Bureau of Meteorology and compare and contrast the differences in species, reproductive strategies, adaptations and interdependences that allow species to survive and exist in the environments to which the chosen seasonal calendar relates.",

Issue selection phase It is suggested that teachers lead a brainstorming session to review the different issues related to genetics, reproductive science or adaptations beneficial for survival. In this detailed example, following classwork on reproductive strategies and adaptations of species in Gariwerd National Park, a student raised the question about the absence of apex predators in that Park. On further research they discovered that dingoes were the missing predators in the ecosystem and there was a proposal to investigate whether dingoes should be reintroduced into Gariwerd National Park. The student wondered ‘ Should dingoes be reintroduced into Gariwerd National Park? ’ Planning phase Teachers work with students to: set timeframes and milestones for the task determine the nature of the work that is to be completed inside and outside the classroom check the scientific accuracy of content prior to students working on the reporting (communication) phase consider appropriate communication formats for specific audiences. It was determined that students in the class could work independently or in groups to further identify and analyse the issue, but all students were required to present an individual, justified response to the issue. Teachers must consider the management logistics of the investigation, taking into account the number of students, available resources and student interest. The following questions require consideration: To whom will students be expected to communicate their results? What alternative communication formats will students be able to consider? To what extent will students work on their research and response inside and outside class time, and how will student work be monitored and authenticated? Will time be allocated in class for students to present their work to other students? Are students able to investigate a bioethical issue other than the one identified? Teachers could provide students with a template that structures the bioethical issue into a series of timed phases. Students may subsequently adapt the template as a personal work plan in their logbooks. Investigation phase Students were asked to identify their initial intuitive response the question ‘Should dingoes be reintroduced into Gariwerd National Park?’ The VCE Biology Student Ethical Issue Reflection Tool (docx - 101.1kb) is used to support students to record their response. A set of references and useful resources is provided to students to support them when identifying and analysing the issue.

      "content": "Detailed example Project-based learning to explore DNA manipulation using CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing tool Aim To use a Project Based Learning (PBL) approach to investigate DNA and gene structure and the function and application of a gene editing tool, CRISPR-Cas9 both now and into the future. Introduction Students work in small groups to undertake an in-depth inquiry into the use of the protein CRISPR-Cas9, linking to DNA, gene structure and enzymes; and create, compose or produce a product for an authentic audience. Teaching notes This detailed example draws on the principles of PBL developed by the Buck Institute for Education . A PBL approach begins with an open-ended question, which is ideally provocative and engaging so that it captures students’ interest. Students investigate this question and brainstorm possible solutions, learning relevant content during the process. They then apply their learning in creative ways to produce, demonstrate or perform something, advocate for a policy or solution, or teach something to others, practising their communication skills in the process. Each student-centred project is broken down into three main stages, which can overlap in time frame: inquire/discover/research create/compose/produce present/share/promote. Teachers may provide questions for investigation or develop these questions in conjunction with their students. A manageable way to tackle this task may be: determine the questions to be investigated as a class student groups share their groups’ learning with their class peers students complete a ‘compare and contrast matrix’ for the presentations. Assessment can include self- and peer-assessment questionnaires and a compare and contrast matrix. In this way the contribution of each student within any group is accounted for. Approximate time frames are proposed for each stage. Key science skills Teachers should identify and inform students of the relevant key science skills that are embedded in the task. Preparation Students may need assistance in deconstructing the investigation question. ​​Teachers could also discuss the necessary skills required to work well in a group, including perseverance and a positive attitude. Health and safety note There are no specific health and safety concerns associated with this activity. Stage 1: Inquire/discover/research CRISPR babies: when will the world be ready? ( Refer to an article in Nature ). God in a Kit: The perils and possibilities of a tool called CRISPR (Refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald ). From the stimulus articles, students choose an investigation question that interests them personally; ideally they make their personal interest in it explicit by recording initial ideas in the logbook. Form teams of three to four people who have some interest in the same investigation question. The teacher may facilitate this. As a team, brainstorm what they do know and do not know about the investigation question. What specific questions do they need to investigate further? Use key science skills and key knowledge to guide and inform the research. Each student should keep evidence of the process in their logbooks. Consider how the investigation question affects different people and the issues it raises – research, identify and describe relevant individuals, stakeholders and community groups. What specific questions need further investigation? Students need to keep evidence of the process in their logbooks and also keep a record of where they sourced the information in case they need to return to it later. Review the selected investigation question and reframe/rewrite it if necessary to include specific parameters (for example, to refine it to a particular example). Nominate valid sources, such as organisations or professionals in the field, who might be able to supply information to help answer the specific questions identified as requiring further investigation. Collect as much information as possible on the investigation question by dividing up these tasks between individuals within the group. Remember to agree on a timeline for completion. This might include using methods such as: online/library research; photo and video documentation; experimental data; and highlighting experts with a variety of different viewpoints. Each student should keep and share a careful log of their research – dates, times, sources, observations, summaries, etc. As a group, analyse the evidence collated and create charts, graphs and/or other visual representations to understand the findings. Stage 2: Create/compose/produce Based on their research, ask what specific process/solution they would like to compose that addresses the investigation question. Their task is to make public a strong, convincing explanation to a real/authentic audience. Does the group want to design a website, plan a community information event, improve an existing project/program, make a presentation to interested people? Or something else? Identify all the steps required to make this stage happen. Make contact with their real/authentic audience and present to them a very brief description of the intended product and the reason for the inquiry into the investigation question. Students keep evidence of their contact in their logbooks. Create the product and collect evidence of the process. Stage 3: Present/share/promote Present the final product to class peers for initial review. Randomly selected class peers complete an assessment questionnaire (based on criteria in a provided assessment rubric). Complete self- and team peer-assessment questionnaires. Deliver the final product to the real/authentic audience. Collect evidence of the process. Randomly selected audience members complete assessment questionnaires. Students complete a written ‘compare and contrast matrix’ for the selected question that addresses the following categories: factors that influence the use of CRISPR-Cas9, the scientific understanding and the potential issues, including identifying probably stakeholders and possible solutions.

      "title": "Fieldwork – How does leaf shape differ between native and introduced plant species and how does this link to photosynthesis?",
      "content": "Detailed example Fieldwork – How does leaf shape differ between native and introduced plant species and how does this link to photosynthesis? Based on scientific inquiry, fieldwork involves observing and interacting with a selected environment beyond the classroom, usually in an attempt to determine correlation rather than causal relationship. It may be conducted through direct qualitative and / or quantitative observations and sampling, participant observation, interviews and questionnaires. Key science skills Identify, inform and teach students a selection of key science skills that are embedded in the task. Compare the epidermal cellular structures (such as stomata) from the leaves of different wheat varieties. Suggest which might be best for a low rainfall environment (Part B). Comparing leaf shape in Australian native and non-native plants The practical investigation allows students develop, use and demonstrate related key science skills while drawing on key knowledge. Teachers must consider the management logistics of the practical investigation, taking into account the number of students, available resources and student interest. The following questions require consideration: What input would students have into the selection of the investigation question? What input would students have into the design of the fieldwork exercises? Will different groups of students in the class be able to undertake different investigations? Is class data pooling a possibility? Will off-school site work be involved? Is the investigation reliant on particular weather conditions and/or accessibility constraints? Teachers could provide students with a template that structures the investigation into a series of timed phases. Students may subsequently adapt the template as a personal work plan in their logbooks. Topic selection phase In this detailed example, the investigation question is generated following stimulus articles such as ‘narrow leaves make better crops for future climates’. One student wondered why narrow leaves would be better, suggesting wider leaves would be better for plant growth. Another student considered Australian native trees and their narrow leaf shape. This led to discussions about indigenous, native and introduced plant species and how leaf shape is linked to photosynthesis. From this discussion students generated a question for investigation: How does leaf shape compare between native and introduced plant species? How might this impact on rates of photosynthesis and biochemical pathways? Planning phase Students may need guidance in: fitting the investigation into the time available, and developing a work plan identifying native and introduced plant species in the field conducting a simple literature review developing hypotheses and distinguishing between a hypothesis, prediction and conclusion. Teachers should work with students to: identify and negotiate undertaking of various investigations by different students or student groups within the parameters of the question. Investigation phase Student-designed methodologies must be approved by the teacher prior to students undertaking practical investigations. A possible general management plan for the investigation follows. Determine the fieldwork site(s) and sampling plan, informed by the hypothesis. Determine the type of data collection (quantitative or qualitative), type of survey (direct or indirect), sampling size, reducing bias with replication and randomisation, any tools needed for data collection. Determine how data will be collected (photos and/or samples) and recorded. If collecting samples, minimise environmental impact. Determine how data will be analysed and evaluated. Consider how to construct evidence-based arguments and draw conclusions, linking to literature and current research. Reporting phase Students consider the data collected, report on any errors or problems encountered, and use evidence to explain and answer the investigation question. Differences in leaf shape should be related to the factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis and photosynthesis as a biochemical pathway, including the impact on enzyme function within pathway. The above phases could be recorded in the student logbook. The report of the investigation can take various forms including a written report, a scientific poster or an oral presentation of the investigation.

      "title": "What is immunotherapy and how is it used to treat cancer?",
      "content": "Detailed example What is immunotherapy and how is it used to treat cancer? Using a case study to inspire investigation into immunotherapy, create knowledge and challenge misconceptions to create a conceptual model to simulate a system, to enhance understanding and inform others. As adapted from the Contemporary VCE Biology website (topic: Immunotherapy). Aims identify that immunotherapy is the use of a person’s immune system to fight disease understand the potential for immunotherapy in treating cancer understand the process of adoptive T-cell therapy describe an overview of the processes involved in CAR T-cell therapy Key science skills Identify, inform and teach students a selection of key science skills that are embedded in the task. Background information for teachers This section introduces immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer. Immunotherapy uses a patient’s own immune responses to fight cancer. The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer has been evolving rapidly over the last couple of decades. Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT), employing a patient’s own cultured T cells is an emerging treatment for a variety of cancers. In ACT, the patient's T cells are removed in a process known as apheresis. The T cells known to fight the particular cancer in the patient are grown in a laboratory and inserted back into the patient’s body. Recently there has been the evolution of CAR T cells. CAR stands for chimeric antigen receptors, which is a type of antigen-targeted receptor that has been genetically engineered onto a patient’s own T cell. The use of genetic engineering approaches to insert antigen-targeted receptors of defined specificity into T cells has greatly enhanced the potential capabilities of ACT. These CAR T cells are better able to seek out and kill specific target cells (Magee 2014). Cytotoxic T cells, also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are specialised white blood cells that, when activated, seek out and kill infected cells. The CAR T cells are cytotoxic T cells that have been genetically modified to improve the ability to target and kill cancer cells. Students investigate the structure and actions of cytotoxic T cells and how they detect and attack cancers cells, also known as target cells. Students engage in a number of concrete and creative activities, including being introduced to appropriate scientific vocabulary, and demonstrating their understanding of the cellular processes involved in T cell mediated killing. Students are introduced to investigative research aimed at improving CAR T cell technology. Students may observe videos from scientists at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) who are involved in research to improve the efficacy of CAR T cells. To inspire investigation and engage and motivate learners to want to understand how T-cell therapies work in the treatment of cancer, visit the Cancer Research Institute website and watch the case study of Emily Whitehead, the first child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to be treated with CAR T-cell therapy, with amazing results. Activity 1 : What is Immunotherapy? Teachers can choose to use one or all of the following activities: a mind map, think-pair-share, listing pros and cons. Whole class mind map Create a whole-class mind map about students' understanding of immunotherapy within the scope of the case study of Emily Whitehead. Suggested mind map headings could be, but are not limited to: Immunotherapy, T cells, CAR T cells, Cancer, Clinical Trials. List class questions, wonderings and areas for further investigation. Place the mind map on the classroom wall for the duration of the unit. Student mind map or Venn diagram Create an individual or small-group student mind map or Venn diagram about students' understanding of immunotherapy within the scope of the case study of Emily Whitehead. Students list wonderings, questions, and areas for further investigation. Place the mind map or Venn diagram in the logbook. Think-Pair-Share Students undertake a collaborative activity to answer the question(s): What is immunotherapy? What is CAR T-cell therapy? Students think individually about the question(s), undertake independent research and then share ideas with a classmate. This activity could be used for students who have difficulty in sharing within a whole-class forum. Pros and Cons Students list the pros and cons of using CAR T-cell therapy. This list can be generated by individuals or from group discussion. Discuss potential issues with immunotherapy. Activity 2: Visualising Adoptive T-cell therapy Students use a range of visual strategies to represent their understanding of the key processes of immunotherapy using T cells, demonstrating a range of key knowledge and key science skills, as decided by the class. Visual representation can be in the form of, but not limited to a: Flow diagram Mind map Concept map Illustration DigiExplanation – using appropriate digital technologies Students share their visual representations as a class or in small groups. Students are encouraged to ask questions, challenge explanations and discuss the similarities and differences in representations and how they assist in learning. Students reflect on the class and/or individual mind map to document their learning.

      "title": "Classification and Identification – What are phylogenetic trees and how are they used to show evidence of relatedness between species?",
      "content": "Detailed example Classification and Identification – What are phylogenetic trees and how are they used to show evidence of relatedness between species? Classification is the arrangement of phenomena, objects or events into manageable sets, whereas identification is a process of recognition of phenomena as belonging to particular sets or possibly being part of a new or unique set. As adapted from: Contemporary VCE Biology Aims Create, use and interpret phylogenetic trees to show evidence of the relatedness between species, including structural morphology, homologous structures and molecular homology. Explore consequences of viral antigenic drift and shift in terms of ongoing challenges for viral identification and treatment strategies in the context of the novel corona virus. Key science skills Identify, inform and teach students a selection of key science skills that are embedded in the task. Teacher background information Phylogeny is the study of evolutionary relationships between organisms. It is best represented through diagrams called phylogenetic trees, which evidence relatedness between species and the presence of common ancestors. Teaching phylogeny can often be challenging, since concepts such as geological time and geographical changes on Earth are usually hard to comprehend. Using interactives can support teaching and student learning, with specific learning outcomes and/or discussion points identified (for example, EarthViewer on the HHMI BioIneractive website . Unsurprisingly, there are several misconceptions around evolution, caused both by intuitive thinking and widespread misleading representations of evolutionary processes. Ballen & Greene (2017) argue that teaching about biodiversity using the traditional Linnaean rank-based approach (dividing organisms into Kingdom, Phyla, Class and so on) can potentially disseminate some of these misconceptions, since it omits evolutionary innovations and inaccurately portrays history. Instead, the authors defend the use of the clade-based approach, which teaches about biodiversity using phylogenetic trees. Misconceptions – ‘Trees not ladders’ on the Berkely University website . Understanding evolution – Phylogenetics on the Berkely University website . Activity 1: Which information would you use to group organisms? To assess students’ prior knowledge, choose five organisms and promote a whole-class discussion on which sources of data could be valuable when determining relatedness between species. For example, when comparing mammals, would the coat-colour be a relevant trait? Or perhaps the eating habits (herbivore, carnivore)? Which characteristics matter more when grouping organisms and why? How would you know if a black panther is more closely related to a black bear than to a tiger? Extending on this discussion, challenge students to represent the relatedness between the chosen organisms, with an explanation of their diagram. As an alternative to the whole-class discussion, separate students into small groups to develop their ideas and compare diagrams. Students suggest why there are different diagrams and what further information may be needed. Students note diagrams and reflections in their logbook. Activity 2: Evolutionary researchers – what do they do? What does an evolutionary researcher do, what data is needed and why do this work? (Resource: Phylogeny on the Contemporary VCE Biology website ) Students consider and document their opinions, knowledge and wonderings before and after listening to the work of Dr Matthew Symond, evolutionary researcher from Deakin University, discussing biogeography, ethnobotany and phylogenetic trees. What did they learn? How has their opinions and knowledge changed? Compare with other students. What else did they learn? What more do they want to know? Activity 3: Building phylogenetic trees – using pictures, structural morphology and molecular data Evolutionary researchers from Deakin University (Dr Matthew Symond and his PhD student Uday Sundara) discuss phylogeny, describing the types of data used for reconstructing phylogenetic trees, how accurate these representations can be and some of the complexities involved in the process of reconstructing evolutionary history. The two researchers go on to give examples of phylogenetic trees they generated in their lab, and comment on the differences between morphological and molecular data as evidence of relatedness between species. (Resource: Phylogeny on the Contemporary VCE Biology website ) Students watch the video ‘ Evidence for Relatedness ’ and document their understanding using multimodal representation such as a mind map, drawings and/or text. Students write down further wonderings and/or highlight where they may need further clarification. Building a phylogenetic tree using structural morphology.
