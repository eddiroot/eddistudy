      "description": "Detailed exampleEdible water capsules – a biodegradable co-polymer designed to degradeIntroductionThis highly engaging practical activity involves students making a calcium alginate co-polymer in such a manner that forms beads or capsules containing water inside. Being made from food-safe feedstocks, these gel-like beads are effectively liquid capsules that can be easily bitten or torn to release the liquid inside. Innovation globally is focused on marketing these to replace and reduce the production of plastic drinking containers. Notpla is a sustainable packaging company that has demonstrated the application of biodegradable, edible sachets that naturally degrade in 4–6 weeks, compared to over 750 years for traditionally designed sachets.The co-polymer, calcium alginate is formed by adding together calcium lactate and sodium alginate, which are both safe, renewable, and inexpensive. Sodium alginate is a naturally occurring chemical derived from brown algae (macro algae better known as seaweed). Calcium lactate is prepared from lactic acid, potentially derived from corn, and calcium carbonate. The waste generated producing these beads is environmentally safe. The calcium alginate beads can either be eaten or are readily biodegradable. A simplified version of the chemistry involved can be explained at a Unit 1 level. Essentially, the sodium ions (Na+) in sodium alginate are replaced by calcium ions (Ca2+). As a 2+ ion, the calcium ions are able to electrostatically interact with the carboxylate groups (RCOO-) of two different alginate chains, leading to the weakly cross-linked co-polymer calcium alginate. The chemistry is explored further in the publicly available in an article in Chemistry Teacher International described in the teacher notes below.If it has not been introduced already during Unit 1, this fun practical activity is a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate to students the application of green chemistry principles. This activity clearly demonstrates designing safer products with benign chemicals, the use of renewable feedstocks, and designing to degrade.Materials required: Relevant glassware, 0.6% w/v sodium alginate stock solution (0.6 g in 100 mL deionised water), 0.6% w/v calcium lactate stock solution (0.6 g in 100 mL deionised water), food colouring solution (blue, green, red), disposable pipettes with the tip cut off or large measuring spoons for bigger beads, spoons, petri dishes or watch glasses.Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant science skills embedded in the task.Health and safety notes Students should understand that while these beads have been made with food-safe feedstocks, they have been made with chemical laboratory equipment in a school laboratory. Students should therefore be strongly advised to not eat the calcium alginate beads. Alternatively, the experiment could be conducted using plastic containers and measuring spoons in a non-laboratory teaching space. MethodAdd 50 mL of the prepared 0.6% w/v sodium alginate solution into a clean beaker. Add a few drops of coloured food dye and stir with a glass stirring rod to have a consistently coloured solution. Add 50 mL of the prepared 0.6% w/v calcium lactate solution into a separate clean beaker. Using a plastic pipette that has had the tip cut off (to make a bigger opening and thus bigger drop), take in some coloured sodium alginate solution and add 3–5 drops slowly to the calcium alginate solution. This video link demonstrates the procedure. Diagram 1"

      "description": "Detailed exampleUse of socratic seminars to support student agency in exploring contemporary chemistry-related issues in societyIntroductionSocratic seminars can be used to develop students’ skills in questioning and communicating scientific ideas. These seminars value discussion rather than debate, and inquiry rather than information. They involve students discussing open-ended questions to which there may be a variety of views, listening to the comments of other students, and expressing their own ideas and their responses to the ideas of others. Socratic seminars require that students work cooperatively and question critically and politely. Students may respectfully challenge other students’ interpretations or offer alternative views. In this example, Socratic seminars will be used as a technique to support student agency in responding to a chemistry-related question of interest involving sustainable futures. The teacher uses it after students have selected a research question to investigate and have completed and collated their background research.Planning before the Socratic seminarStudents self-select into groups to research a question of interest associated with one of four investigation topics listed on pages 26–29 of the VCE Chemistry Study Design, and related to the overall question in the area of study, ‘How can chemical principles be applied to create a more sustainable future?’ Time should be allocated for students to research their questions both inside and outside of class. Students may work in pairs on the same question, but each student must record their own background research and notes in their logbook, and present their own response to their research question.Establish conduct protocols for the Socratic seminars with the class. Guidelines may include: one person speaking at a time everyone has a turn in speaking and asking questions understanding that different people will have different points of view about controversial topics ensuring that discussions focus on the arguments and views presented by each student without criticism of the person. Either before the Socratic seminar, or at the initial stage, an open-ended question for each of the four investigation topics should be developed; for example, ‘How can endangered elements in the periodic table be saved?’, ‘How can ‘greener’ polymers be produced?’, ‘How can chemistry be used to explain some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander practices involving the use of natural substances?’ and ‘How can commercial products or materials be manufactured more sustainably?’Implementation of the Socratic seminar Step 1Organise students into two equal groups for each investigation topic to form an inner circle and an outer circle. Students in the inner circle should respond to the open-ended question relevant to their topic. They should not speak to the teacher; instead, they should speak to the other students in the inner circle. They should listen to each others’ ideas about the question and ask their own further questions to facilitate deeper understanding.Students sitting in the outer circle should not speak during the seminar. They should observe and actively listen. They may record questions that could be presented to students in the inner circle at the end of the inner circle discussions, or they could present clarifying questions and / or comments to students in the inner circle at the end of the seminar, or they could be asked to summarise the main points in the discussions between students in the inner circle. If teachers have organised more than one set of inner and outer circle seminars, then one student in the outer circle should be appointed to ensure that student discussions in the inner circle are on-topic. Step 2Swap the students in the inner and outer circles so that the students previously in the outer circle have the opportunity to discuss their ideas, and students previously in the inner circle listen to the second seminar and make notes, as in Step 4. Step 3Pair students – one from the inner circle and one from the outer circle – to undertake a think-pair-share reflection about the Socratic seminars. Students may share what they found interesting about the seminars, what points require further clarification, and / or how the discussions relate to the overarching area of study question as well as to their own research question. Step 4Conduct a debriefing session to evaluate the strategies that enabled a better understanding of the overarching area of study question and the individual research questions, and to discuss the feedback offered through the seminars.ExtensionSocratic seminars may also be used at the end of Unit 1 Area of Study 3 to provide students with an overview of various contemporary chemistry applications in society and how chemistry contributes to a sustainable future. Students seated in the outer circle may be required to summarise the main points of the chemistry questions investigated by the class and presented in the inner circle of a Socratic seminar."

      "description": "Detailed exampleThe effect of pH on the colour formed from naturally dyed wool IntroductionA common practical activity to introduce the concept of acid and base is to have students inquire into making pH indicator solutions from natural products (cabbage) and demonstrating their colour at different pH levels. While engaging in this inquiry, students are quickly moved on to other indicators (such as phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue) traditionally used in chemistry.The practical activity below extends this ‘natural indicator’ concept further and applies it to a real-world context – the dyeing of wool fibres. The chemistry of wool yarn is complex, but at its simplest it can be described as an amphoteric material, as it contains both cationic (positively charged due to the presence of -NH3+) and anionic (negatively charged due to the presence of -COO-) reactive sites. Having both sites means a change in pH in either direction impacts the relative ratio of -NH3+ and -COO-, which in turn varies how the dye interacts with the wool.This activity has two parts. First, dye solutions are made from natural products. Second, the pH of the solutions is changed in a systematic manner, and strands of wool are heated gently in the dye solution while students observe the new colour of the wool. Part 1 involves 30 minutes of heating and to save time, these solutions could be pre-made for the students. Alternatively, this step could be undertaken in a previous lesson with the dye solutions stored until use. Possible extension activities are outlined in the teacher notes below.Materials required: Relevant glassware (small beakers, glass stirring rod), apparatus to heat solutions (a hot plate, or a tripod and gauze mat over a Bunsen burner), pieces of wool yarn cut to consistent length, acetic acid or vinegar, 1 M ammonia solution, a pen to label beakers, paper towel, natural products for dye solutions (green tops from carrots, yellow onion skins), kitchen equipment if needed (knife, chopping board), sandwich bags to store the dyed wool, pH strips or a pH meter. Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant science skills embedded in the task.Health and safety notesStudents should wear appropriate personal protective equipment because ammonia and its vapours can damage the eyes.Students should be advised to not wear contact lenses during this experiment because gaseous vapours may condense on the contact lens and damage the eye. Dilute ammonia solution is used here, however it would still be prudent to use ammonia only in a well-ventilated area.Method Part 1: Prepare the dye solutionsCut the carrot tops into pieces, with enough to fill approximately 100–150 mL of a 250 mL beaker. Fill to 250 mL with distilled water and place the beaker on the heating apparatus.Likewise, take the onion skins and fill approximately 100–150 mL of a 250 mL beaker, cover with distilled water and place the beaker on the heating apparatus. Raise the temperature of both solutions and let simmer (hot but not boiling) for 30 minutes. Carefully decant the liquid from each solution into two clean, dry 250 mL beakers. Either use immediately, or label and store to conduct Part 2 in another lesson. Part 2: Dying wool at different pHWith six small beakers (100–150 mL), separate both the carrot top solution and the onion skin solution into three equal amounts. For one beaker of each solution, use a pH meter or pH strips to check and record the pH of the beakers. Label these beakers appropriately (control, or neutral pH).For one beaker of each solution, add dropwise acetic acid (or vinegar) and stir until the pH is approximately 3–4 (requires 2–3 mL depending on how much dye solution is used). Use a pH meter or pH strips to check and record the pH of the beakers. Label these beakers appropriately.For one beaker of each solution, add dropwise 1 M ammonia solution and stir until the pH is approximately 9–10 (requires 2–3 mL depending on how much dye solution is used). Use a pH meter or pH strips to check and record the pH of the beakers. Label these beakers appropriately.Take one strand of wool yarn (cut to a consistent length, ~10cm) and add to each beaker. Over a heating apparatus, heat gently (hot but not boiling) each beaker for 15–20 minutes. Fill a large 500 mL beaker with warm tap water.Using a glass stirring rod, lift the wool strand out of the beaker and dunk into the warm water. Swirl the wool strand around to rinse it thoroughly. Lift the thread out and place on a paper towel to dry. For storage, the dyed wool can be kept in Ziploc or sandwich bags (the dyes will leach over time so it is not advised to keep the dyed wool in pockets!). Discussion questions and report writing in logbookStudents should record their results in a table showing the dye solution used in each instance, the pH of the dyed solution, and the resultant colour of the wool yarn. Students can be tasked to describe the ratio of -NH3+ and -COO- reactive sites on the wool strand at each pH. Referring to pH, students could be asked to predict what would happen if each strand was washed with soapy water, which is basic. Teacher notesThis practical activity example has been modified from a Natural Dyes Lab practical activity from Beyond Benign. The resource contains a teacher description of the two parts of the activity, along with a third part which involves students experimenting in a controlled manner to discover how the colour changes by the addition of a mordant (metal ions from CuSO4, Al2(SO4)3 or FeSO4, that form coordination complexes with the dyes, improving the fastness of the bond between the dye and the natural fibre). The resource contains student sheets for the three activities along with worked solutions.Another extension activity would be to test the fastness of the dye. The wool strands could be tested in a controlled manner to see how durable the colour formed becomes. The coloured wool strands could be rubbed on a rough surface systematically; they could be washed in a soap solution, or they could be left exposed to UV light for a set amount of time. It is likely the colour will disappear easily without the addition of a mordant (copper or alum) – see the third activity suggested by Beyond Benign). In this activity, the green tops of carrot and yellow onion skins were used to form the natural dye solutions, but other natural products could be trialled. Recent studies have shown black rice, containing anthocyanin, to be an excellent natural dye. However, it is advisable to heat the black rice for a longer time, so this step should be pre-prepared for the students. Tea bags with dried flowers (dandelion, elderberry, camomile) will also work well. In the dye industry, dyes are themselves often classed as basic (‘cationic’) or acidic (‘anionic’) dyes. While the chemistry of how dyes interact with reactive sites on fibres such as wool is complex, students could be encouraged to draw out the chemical structure of common acid and base dyes they find on the internet or in textbooks, and label the parts of the chemical structure that take part in acid / base reactions. With a curriculum connection to Unit 1, students could investigate artificial fibres, and how dyes interact with these co-polymer-based fabrics. Students investigating fabrics will also discover that twice as much polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is used for fabrics than for PET bottles. Antimony, a heavy metal that is toxic to both humans and the environment, is used as a catalyst in the PET process, which poses a health and environmental concern when antimony is leached from the fabric. Green chemistry-relevant innovation is focused on making antimony-free artificial fibres for different applications.Using natural dyes as opposed to artificial dyes will be an obvious sustainable development context for teachers and students to explore here. Another will be to consider the environmental impact of industrial effluent (waste solutions), and how these are being re-purposed in a circular economy."

      "description": "Detailed exampleResponding to a chemistry-based issue in society: would you drink recycled water?AimTo communicate a justified response to a social issue involving chemistry concepts through participation in a Question & Answer panel discussion.IntroductionTeacher poses the question, ‘Would you drink recycled water?’ as a summative learning task following learning activities related to measurements of solubility and concentrations, chemical analysis or a class excursion to a water treatment plant. The focus of this activity is on students being able to consider the nature of evidence, distinguish between facts and opinion, and synthesise arguments to communicate a response to a chemistry-related social issue.Teachers could organise the class so that students work in groups to form a number of different Q&A panels where each student takes on the role of a different stakeholder, or use a jigsaw approach to create one class Q&A panel with each panelist having a team of ‘researchers’ to assist in the development of panel arguments. Students role-play a Q&A panel discussion to examine the arguments for and against using recycled water as a source of drinking water. Each student will assume the role of one stakeholder, or become part of the stakeholder’s research team, and become part of the panel discussion. Following the panel discussion each student provides an individual response to the question ‘Would you drink recycled water?’ by producing a public communication in an agreed format; for example, newspaper article, infographic or TV advertisement. The communication must include referenced qualitative and quantitative data, distinction between identified facts and opinions presented in the Q&A panel discussion, and a justified personal stance on the question.Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant key science skills embedded in the task.PreparationPrior learning experiences related to water sampling techniques, measurement of solubility and concentration, and analytical techniques used to analyse for salts, organic compounds, and acids and bases. Prior consideration of validity, facts and opinions; for example, students have discussed sources of reliable information related to the following chemistry-based information: Drinking water, also known as potable water or improved drinking water, is defined as water that is safe enough for drinking and food preparation.Globally, in 2020, 74% of people used safely managed water services (improved source accessible on premises, available when needed and free of contamination) compared with 70% in 2015. Students should have discussed examples of ‘effective’ and ‘ineffective’ oral and written communication techniques and practices. Students become panel members who represent stakeholder interests (students select the names of stakeholders at random ‘from a hat’); for example, local resident with young family, mayor, local water authority representative, analytical chemist, site worker from company contracted to carry out water treatment, medical professional, local producer of carbonated water, meteorologist, and environmental activist.Students should have access to ‘fact sheets’ or authoritative sites related to water treatment and drinking water specifications; for example, excerpts from the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, the World Health Organization’s guidelines for drinking water quality, and comparisons of drinking water standards around the world, such as those provided by the Safe Drinking Water Foundation (SDWF).Health, safety and ethical notesStudents should be respectful of others and their opinions at all times. Students should be reminded that this activity is simply a role-play and the comments made do not necessary reflect the attitudes of the individual speakers.Procedure Lessons 1 and 2: In these lessons students consider general information about the process of treating water to make it potable, including statutory requirements for water to be classified as ‘drinkable’; put themselves in the role of one stakeholder and present their position; construct a question they would like addressed by a discussion panel; and prepare possible responses to these questions from their perspective as one stakeholder. Some time out of class may also be required for students to complete background research. Students:Read through the ‘fact sheets’ or websites relating to water treatment and water quality.Note in the logbook major points of interest.Select at random the name of a stakeholder relevant to the issue. Spend 10 minutes brainstorming the likely perspective of the stakeholder towards the issue. Students may discuss their ideas with peers and the teacher. Students need to consider the biases (feelings, opinions, prejudices) that their stakeholder may have for this issue and write these into the logbook.Present a 20-second oral summary of the stakeholder to the class, for example: ‘My name is X and I am the mayor of this town where it is proposed that we supplement our drinking water supplies with treated water, since we often need to apply water restrictions due to low water reserves in our dam. The majority of my constituents are against the proposal since there are concerns that the treated water will still contain microbes or chemicals that may threaten human health and that treated water could never exactly replicate the quality of rain water or the water in our dams.’On a slip of paper, construct one question that they would like addressed by someone relating to this case study. Students may suggest which stakeholder they would like to primarily respond to their question. The question should be well thought out so as to give maximum insight into different perspectives in considering the issue. Students may use the following list of question terms to assist them:List 1: Who / What / Where / When / Why / How…? List 2: …would / could / should / is / are / might / will / was / were…? Submit the question to the teacher, who will collate (perhaps by photocopying all slips onto a single sheet of paper) and distribute them to the relevant discussion panel. Now working with the other members of the panel, discuss the questions that have been submitted and write notes in the logbook detailing the response to these questions from the perspective of a stakeholder. Include as much scientific data as possible in the responses. Students may need to conduct additional Internet research to develop responses.Lesson 3: In this lesson students role-play the perspective of one stakeholder as part of a panel discussion. They may use any notes already written in the logbook and may also make additional notes in the logbook during the class. Lesson 4: In this lesson students provide an individual response to the question ‘Would you drink recycled water?’ by producing a public communication in an agreed format; for example, newspaper article, infographic or TV advertisement. At the end of the lesson they submit a draft of their response. They may use any notes from the logbook.The communication must include referenced qualitative and quantitative data, distinction between identified facts and opinions presented in the Q&A panel discussion, and a justified personal stance on the question. The media communication should identify / highlight:a likely target audience specific scientific concept(s) being communicateddistinction between fact and opinionscientific data used to justify position of the stakeholder.Students will be assessed with respect to:accuracy of scientific informationclarity of explanationsappropriateness for purpose and audience."

      "description": "Detailed exampleHow does water quality differ at various points along a river?IntroductionThis practical investigation builds on knowledge and skills developed in Unit 2 Area of Study 1 and / or Unit 2 Area of Study 2. Teachers must consider the management logistics of the investigation, taking into account number of students, available resources and student interest. The following questions require consideration:What input will students have into the selection of the investigation question? Will different groups of students in the class be able to undertake different investigations?To what extent will all students consider the same investigation question, or complete different parts to the same question so that class data can be collated? What input will students have into the design of the experiment?Will off-school site work be involved?Teachers could provide students with a template that structures the investigation into a series of timed phases. The template may subsequently be adapted by students as a personal work plan in their logbooks.Topic selection phaseIn Unit 2 Area of Study 2, the teacher made use of the local river that ran through the town to explore concepts related to identifying and measuring different substances in water. In this detailed example, a general class investigation question was generated following student interest in exploring factors that affected the river’s water quality. In a class discussion following Unit 2 Area of Study 2 activities where students measured the pH and total dissolved solids of river water samples, students wondered whether their results would have been different if they had performed the experiments at different times of the day or in different seasons of the year. They discussed the different environment conditions at various points in the river, such as shaded or exposed sites, and treed versus cleared areas. One environmentally conscious student noted that a public picnic ground abutted the river and that paper, plastic and food scraps often ended up in the river. Another student referred to sections of the river allocated to swimming and boating activities and wondered whether factors such as body oils and turbulence affected water quality. From this discussion students formulated a number of research questions for investigation, based on a general question: How does water quality differ at various points along a river?Sample student-generated research questions include:What chemical categories of rubbish are dumped into the river and how is water quality affected? How do recreational activities such as swimming and fishing affect water quality?Does exposure to sunlight affect the pH of water?Does exposure to sunlight affect the solubility of salts in water? Do overhanging trees change the chemical composition of the water?Is the proportion of chemicals in faster-running parts of the river different from the proportion of chemicals in slower-running parts of the river?Is the proportion of chemicals in deeper parts of the river different from the proportion of chemicals in shallower parts of the river?Planning phaseStudents may need guidance in:formulating a testable hypothesisfitting the investigation into the time available, and developing a work planidentifying the technical skills involved in the investigationensuring that resources are available that meet the requirements of the investigation. Teachers should work with students to:determine to what extent students will work independently or in groups in undertaking the experiment (for example, different students or groups may investigate different aspects of river quality; all students may investigate a selected question and work at different sites along the river to collect and collate data; a limited number of questions may be self-selected for investigation by students)discuss the independent, dependent and controlled variables in proposed experimentsdetermine the types of quantitative experiments that will be performed; for example titrations, solubility tests, instrumental analysisidentify safety aspects associated with undertaking experiments in the field and in the laboratory, and in working with chemicals and apparatusestablish the use of physical units of measurement and standard notationdetermine the nature of the communication: Who would be interested in the results of students' investigations? What would be the most effective way to communicate results to an interested audience?Investigation phaseStudent-designed methodologies must be approved by the teacher prior to students undertaking practical investigations. A possible schedule for management of the multiple investigations in the class is as follows:each student undertakes internet research to find background information related to the general topic for investigationstudents work individually or in groups to confirm a research question, formulate a hypothesis and propose a research methodology, including management of relevant safety and health issuesteacher approval for the methodology is granted prior to students undertaking the investigationtime is allocated for water sample collection in the fieldif required, time is allocated to access equipment / instrumentation out-of-school students perform investigations, record and analyse results and prepare final presentation of their findings using an agreed report format.Reporting phaseStudents consider the data collected, report on any errors or problems encountered, and use evidence to explain and answer the investigation question. Other avenues for further investigation may be developed following evaluation of their experimental design and quality of data.Students may work individually or in groups.The above phases could be recorded in the student logbook. The report of the investigation can take various forms including a written report, a scientific poster or a multimedia or oral presentation of the investigation."

      "description": "Detailed exampleIs there a relationship between the temperature rise in direct metal displacement reactions and the voltage of the galvanic cells driven by those reactions?IntroductionA systematic investigation of direct metal displacement reactions can be used to establish or to confirm an electrochemical series. Exothermic metal displacement reactions can be used to drive galvanic cells, in which the energy released in the reaction is in the form of electrical energy instead of heat energy. Students should record a justified prediction of the metal displacement reactions in their logbooks prior to undertaking the experimental investigation.The temperature rise that occurs in metal displacement reactions, which is directly proportional to the heat energy released, is determined by using a temperature probe. The voltage across the galvanic cells driven by those reactions is measured using a voltmeter connected in parallel with each cell. The voltage is directly proportional to the electrical energy delivered by the cell per second by the relationship. Required: relevant glassware, equipment and materials including a voltmeter; a globe; electrical wiring; a temperature probe; strips of zinc, copper, iron and tin; strips of filter paper and solutions of 1.0 M ZnCl2, 1.0 M CuCl2, 1.0 M FeCl2, 1.0 M SnCl2 and 0.1 M NaCl (for salt bridges). Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant science skills embedded in the task.Health and safety notesStudents must:dispose of metal strips and metal solutions in properly labelled waste containers and not down sinks wash their hands after handling the chemicals. MethodStudents place a metal strip in a test tube with a temperature probe, add 20 mL of a 1.0 M solution of one of the test metals, and measure and record the temperature rise that occurs over 5 minutes. They also record their observations of any reaction that they observe over that time. This is repeated for a range of combinations of metals and metal solutions and the results compared with their predictions using the electrochemical series. Students set up galvanic cells, each using one of the metal displacement reactions that are identified as exothermic, and place the same globe across the two electrodes. They measure and record the voltage across each cell. Discussion questions and report writing in logbookStudents complete a results table showing the temperature rise and voltage for each metal combination. They then draw a scatterplot graph of voltage against temperature rise from all the data points to test if there is a relationship between the temperature rise and the voltage.Questions should focus on identification of the dependent and independent variables, controlled variables, sources of error and the validity of this experimental method and how it could be improved.Teacher notesThis is a systematic procedure producing quantitative and qualitative data. Students should be aware that the experiment is not being conducted at standard conditions, as the temperature is not being held constant at 25 oC, and the metal strips are not made from the pure metal. Extensions to this activity may involve students testing other metals, or processing the class results, to create more data points for the scatterplot graph."

      "description": "Detailed exampleCan Le Chatelier’s principle be demonstrated while being green?IntroductionIn schools, a systematic investigation of how changes in temperature, concentration and pressure leads to a change in an equilibrium mixture involves students conducting a series of short laboratory activities where they can clearly visualise the change (for instance, a colour change, a change in pH). While the hands-on activities are engaging and motivating for students, they involve handling toxic and hazardous chemicals (cobalt in solution, dichromate ions, thiocyanate ions) that need to be disposed in a specific manner. In the following practical activities, students can still visualise a colour change from an equilibrium shift but do so with non-toxic materials. In Part 1, students observe the equilibrium shifts that occur to a starch-iodine complex when the solution is heated or cooled. Heating causes a shift to the left (more colourless), whereas cooling causes a shift to the right (more blue-black). Iodine(aq) + Starch(aq) ⇋ Starch-Iodine complex(aq) colourless blue-black In Part 2, students observe the effect of pH on equilibrium on a solution of brewed tea (in this case, a blue solution of butterfly pea tea). Reducing the pH by adding vinegar or lemon juice causes a shift to the left (lighter blue), whereas the addition of baking soda or vinegar causes a shift to the right (darker purple). The relevant molecules in tea are theaflavins, a group of polyphenols. The addition of H+ ions causes the alcohol functional groups of theaflavin to become protonated, resulting in a highly soluble theanaphthoquinone compound (more information is provided in the link below). Tea(aq) + H+(aq) ⇋ TeaH+(aq) blue purple Materials required: relevant glassware, a hot plate or kettle, test tube rack, thermometer, ice, tincture of iodine, soluble starch, vinegar (or lemon juice), baking soda (or dilute ammonia solution), and brewed tea (the original instructions use butterfly pea tea). Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant science skills embedded in the task.Health and safety notesStudents should wear appropriate personal protective equipment, as iodine is a minor eye irritant and vinegar and ammonia can cause skin irritation. Individuals with sensitive skin should wear gloves.Method Part 1 (starch-iodine complex): Students separate an amount of a starch solution into three labelled test tubes, then add a drop of tincture of iodine to all three and stir.One test tube is safely placed in a large beaker containing ice and water. One test tube is safely placed into a large beaker containing hot water (~80 oC). The third remains as the control colour. Students observe the colour change and relate this colour change to the equilibrium shift that occurred. Part 2 (tea): Students separate an amount of a room temperature butterfly pea tea solution into three labelled test tubes. To one test tube, add 10–15 drops of vinegar, stir and observe the colour change. To another test tube, add ~1g of baking soda (or 10–15 drops of dilute ammonia solution), stir and observe the colour change.Students observe the colour change and relate this colour change to the equilibrium shift that occurred. Discussion questions and report writing in logbookStudents complete a results table showing the change in temperature or pH that they instigated in each instance, and the resultant colour change. Students can then relate this to the direction in shift (to the left, the right, or no change). For temperature, students can be asked which direction is exothermic and which direction is endothermic. For pH, students can be asked which direction the equilibrium shifted when pH was lowered and which direction the equilibrium shifted when pH was raised. For a link to green chemistry principles, supplementary questions can be given that provide the equation for other equilibrium mixtures (albeit toxic mixtures) and students have to relate their answers in this practical activity to determine what they would observe if they were to conduct the experiment practically. For example: Cr2O72-(aq) + H2O(l) ⇄ 2CrO42-(aq) + 2H+(aq) orange yellow Students can be asked to predict what colour changes, and thus equilibrium shift, they would observe from the addition of H+, as they did in this practical activity. A follow-up question could ask students to investigate why they didn’t use dichromate ions (because they are hazardous, because they produce unnecessary waste etc.). Teacher notesThis practical activity example has been modified from an Equilbrium/Le Chatelier’s Principle practical activity from Beyond Benign. The resource contains a teacher description of the two activities, further information on theaflavins (a group of polyphenols found in tea), a student pre-lab exercise and student practical activity worksheets along with worked solutions Students can undertake this activity as an initial practical inquiry into Le Chatelier’s principle, or as part of a guided inquiry. Students could be challenged to investigate what other reagents can be used (for instance, experimenting with different types of tea) to get a change in colour."

      "description": "Detailed exampleHydrolysis of urea – a cross-cutting real-world context for high school organic chemistryIntroductionCurriculum concepts of organic chemistry are spread across Units 1–4, which should come as no surprise to educators of chemistry who will be aware of the prominence of studying organic chemistry in science and engineering in post-secondary courses (chemistry, medicine, pharmacy, microbiology, chemical engineering). However, many of the types of reactions studied in Unit 4 Area of Study 1 are difficult to undertake practically in a high school setting, either because they take too long, are messy and difficult to manage with a large class of students; involve solvents or catalysts not normally seen in high schools; or have observations that students find difficult to connect to their learning. As such, large biologically important molecules tend to stay as three-dimensional representations in textbooks and in internet sources. Urea is a biologically important molecule, but it is not large. However, it can be used in a laboratory setting to provide students with observations for (a) the synthesis of primary amines, and (b) the hydrolytic reaction of an amide linkage (through the addition of the enzyme urease acting as a catalyst), breaking down the slightly larger molecule into smaller molecules (CO2 and NH3) for important biological and chemical purposes.

      "description": "Detailed exampleHow can the calorimetric technique for the measurement of the heat content of foods and fuels in a school laboratory be improved?This practical investigation builds on knowledge and skills developed in Unit 3 Area of Study 1 and particularly in Unit 4 Area of Study 2. Teachers are reminded that the students must initially select their own topics within the scope of the school’s resources, frame their own research questions and design their own investigations. BackgroundFollowing work on the heat of combustion of fuels, calorimetry and the heat content of foods, a student has expressed interest in the problem of the loss of heat energy when measuring the heat energy that is released when a fuel or food is burned in a school laboratory. The student has performed a simple experiment in class in which the molar heat of combustion of ethanol was determined by measuring the temperature rise of water contained in a can above the flame. The student has compared this with the published value, noted the large discrepancy with the experimental value and identified some key sources of error that led to this discrepancy. The student has read widely about the design of bomb calorimeters and processed second-hand-data from them and has seen in media reports that in addition to it being used as a material for wall insulation in homes, people suffering from hypothermia or from severe burns are wrapped in aluminium foil to help prevent loss of body heat. The student has expressed an interest in designing an experimental set-up and procedure that will lead to a more accurate result, and poses a question for investigation. The student has proposed an investigation question: ‘How can the calorimetric technique for the measurement of the heat content of foods and fuels in a school laboratory be improved?’Planning the investigationThe student: plans to design and trial different experimental set-ups and procedures to identify which one leads to results that are closest to the published molar heat of combustion of ethanol and the published heat content of a biscuit; in each case the student will use the specific heat capacity of water and the temperature rise of water to determine the heats of combustion of the samplesmakes a written and photographic record of the experimental set-up used in each trial, as well as records all measurements taken (the student’s prior learning includes understanding that each piece of equipment used will have its own specific heat capacity, and that heat energy loss to the surroundings is the major source of error)should seek the assistance of the teacher in identifying the risk factors involved should the investigation include using a source of oxygen to make the combustion more efficient, as is used in a bomb calorimeter. The student consults with the laboratory technician about the equipment, the materials required and the health and safety protocols to be implemented when burning materials. MethodThe student identifies three major areas in which the experimental design might be improved: the container in which the water is heated, the use of insulation around the apparatus, and the flow of oxygen to the flame. The student tests each area in turn, keeping all other variables controlled, and then tests the combination of conditions that has led to the most accurate results. The student is supplied with ethanol, an unopened new packet of biscuits, a spirit burner, a crucible, a wide roll aluminium foil, a large polystyrene foam box, and other relevant equipment and materials. The water container Six different water containers are set up using different shapes and materials. Three are made from copper and the other three from tin-plated steel. For each material, one is a tall cylindrical shape like a drink can, with an open end at the top, one has the same shape and size but has a wooden lid placed over it with two holes for the stirrer and thermometer, and the third is the same as the second with the addition of aluminium foil wrapped tightly around its curved surface. Insulation around the apparatus Three different arrangements are set up. In the first, no insulating material is used. In the second, the entire apparatus is encased in an envelope of aluminium foil with an entry and an exit hole for air-flow on opposite sides. In the third, the polystyrene box is up-ended over the apparatus and two holes are drilled into it at opposite ends for air-flow. Flow of oxygen to the flame Three different arrangements are trialled. In the first, the natural flow of air is used. In the second, a small hair drier is used on a cold setting to slightly increase the speed of air flowing to the flame. In the third, oxygen gas produced by the addition of manganese dioxide catalyst to hydrogen peroxide solution is directed to the flame via a plastic tube. Results The student photographs each set-up that is trialled, and measures and records the mass of the fuel and biscuit burned, and the temperature rise in the same mass of water for both the ethanol and the biscuit for each set of conditions tested. The molar enthalpy of ethanol and the heat content of the biscuits are calculated from these results. The results are presented in two tables, one for ethanol and one for the biscuit. The photographs are printed and appropriately labelled to show the conditions used for each trial.DiscussionThe student analyses the results, and considers the limitations of the investigation and how the investigation could be improved. The student considers the need to account for why the set of conditions that led to the most accurate results for the combustion of the ethanol and of the biscuit worked best.ConclusionThe student uses the data generated to respond to the investigation question asked."

      "description": "The report should be preceded by a laboratory investigation or fieldwork activity that has been fully and / or partially completed under supervision and that has been recorded in a student’s logbook. The investigation or activity must enable primary data to be generated. The data may be analysed prior to the assessment task in the logbook or may be analysed as part of the assessment task. The logbook should be collected by the teacher prior to the assessment task and then re-issued to students at the time of assessment. Students will then refer to the logbook data in producing a report in a format designated by the teacher. Although laboratory investigations may be conducted individually, in small groups or as a class, reports must be completed individually. The investigation of a local water supply, pond or lake is well suited to this task. In selecting a body of water, teachers should note that interesting data will be generated by students if the water contains sediment or a contaminant."

      "task": "Summary report of selected practical investigations",
      "unit": 1,
      "description": "The report should relate to a theme or a common thread in practical investigations, and may assess:conceptual understanding; for example, a set of practical activities related to the properties of materials or acid-base reactions; and / or science skills; for example, comparing precision of results in different investigations or ways of presenting and evaluating numerical data.Topics where there are several experiments that relate to each other and to the concepts in the study design lend themselves particularly well to this assessment task, for example, polymers, water and its properties, acids and bases, and the reactivity of metals.The report should enable students to draw on the investigations nominated by the teacher to compare and discuss particular ideas or understandings. Prompts include instructions such as, ‘Give examples of how X has been considered in the selected investigations’ and questions such as, ‘How can data be represented in different ways to show patterns and relationships?’An alternative approach is for students to select relevant investigations to respond to a question; for example, ‘Select two investigations to show how you dealt with errors, outliers and repeatability.’The summary report is not intended to be a series of short, disconnected practical reports related to different investigations."
