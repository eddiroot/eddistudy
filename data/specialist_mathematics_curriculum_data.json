The following collections of related results can be proved after the initial exploration of ideas using a collection of sample graphs constructed by hand and/or using technology, for example: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics or VISUALGO.net Part 1 Prove that the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any finite graph is even. Show that every simple graph has two vertices of the same degree. Show that if n people attend a party and some shake hands with others (but not with themselves) then at the end, there are at least two people who have shaken hands with the same number of people. Prove that a complete graph with n vertices contains $\\large {\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$ edges. Prove that a finite graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycles of odd length. Part 2 Show that any graph where the degree of every vertex is even has an Euler circuit. Show that if there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, there is an Euler trail from one to the other. Show that if there are more than two vertices of odd degree, it is impossible to construct an Euler trail.
