One of the main aims of changing the language around traditional labels is to shift perceptions of these variations to be positive and to support and empower neurodiverse individuals. Neurodiversity Celebration Week was founded in 2018 to encourage understanding, appreciation and inclusivity for all variations in the neurocognitive abilities of the human population. Consider the information about neurodiversity provided on the Neurodiversity Hub and the extent to which you are familiar with the terms and concepts around neurodiversity.AimTo investigate the level of understanding of neurodiversity in the school. To apply key science skills including planning and conducting investigations, generating, collating and recording data.Task preparation To investigate the extent to which your school community (or another population of choice) is aware of the concept of neurodiversity and the depth of their understanding of various neurodiverse categories, as a class, create a list of key understandings you believe are most important for the general population to have in order to achieve inclusion and empowerment for neurodiverse individuals.Survey creationFrom this information create a Likert scale survey of approximately 20 questions to collect data on attitudes and knowledge around neurodiversity. Questions and statements may be categorised by type of neurodiverse classification, and focus on common misconceptions, stereotypes, abilities and strengths of neurodiverse individuals. Students may create hypotheses around which types of neurodiversity are more commonly understood and may wish to include questions about participants’ demographic details (such as age) to investigate whether there is a correlation between age and familiarity with neurodiversity. Teachers should approve students’ final set of questions to ensure they are appropriately phrased and refer to neurodiversity in a positive manner. It is also important that students create a consent form for participants to demonstrate their understanding of, and adherence to, ethical guidelines and participant rights, including informed consent, voluntary participation, withdrawal and debriefing.Collection of dataEach student should collect a signed consent form from each participant before administering the survey and aim to collect data from at least 5 participants over the age of 18. Results from participants should be recorded to ensure anonymity.Analysis of data Collate the class data and prepare the results in a graphical format relevant to student hypotheses.

However, practice for one cognitive skill, such as concentration, is not necessarily transferable to a different skill, such as problem solving. The evidence suggests that brain training may improve performance on ‘near’ tasks but not ‘far’ tasks (see references below).

Public Interest 17 103–186This activity is intended to be conducted over a number of lessons, as it requires students to engage in training in a cognitive task over time before gathering their primary data on the relative effectiveness of this for improving performance on another task. It should reinforce students’ understanding of the concept of neuroplasticity and introduce them to key concepts in research before they investigate current research in Unit 1 Area of Study 3. AimTo investigate the impact of types of cognitive practice on cognitive task performance.TaskBegin with the research question: Does the type of cognitive practice influence performance on cognitive tasks? and create an appropriate hypothesis. For example, Year 11 students who engage in language-based brain training will perform better on a language-based test than students who engage in non-language-based brain training.Planning phaseOperationalise the IV with three appropriate cognitive tasks to represent different cognitive abilities (such as concentration, problem solving and memory) to become the IV conditions. For example, an active control group playing video games, a non-language-based condition such as playing memory with paired cards, solitaire with playing cards or small Sudoku, and a language-based condition such as playing Wordle (note that students can play more games on paper in pairs, with one student guessing and the other circling letters in the correct colour).Operationalise the DV by deciding on the type of task all students will undertake at the end of the practice phase; for example, a language-based task measured with number of correct responses for a Guardian quick crossword or a non-language-based task measured with time taken to complete a small jigsaw puzzle.Specify a method; for example, completing the allocated cognitive task for the first 5–10 minutes of each Psychology lesson over 3 weeks.Discuss ethical guidelines and provide students with a consent form for their parents to sign to demonstrate appropriate ethical procedures.Randomly allocate students to the control and experimental conditions.Investigation phase – testing ideasFor the training phase, allow students time to participate in the cognitive tasks over a period of time. For the testing, provide all students with the same task.Processing phase – using evidenceCollate the data and present the results in an appropriate graphical format.

Part A: Modelling the human brainMaterials: textbook diagrams, internet models or other pictures of the brain, clay (or plasticine, playdough, papier maché), black pen, paint colours, sharp instrument, piece of paper. Method: Refer to pictures of the brain to shape the clay into a model of the brain.When modelling the brain, use the sharp instrument to model major fissures, gyri and sulci.When the clay brain is dry, use different colours to map out the hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain. Also identify the four lobes of the cerebral cortex and the primary cortex for each of these lobes.Use a fine black pen to number the locations of chosen brain structures.Create a key for the brain model.Discuss and then summarise findings in logbooks. Include digital photographs of the brain models.Note the similarities and differences between different parts of the brain.Identify the strengths and limitations of the brain model.Consider one aspect of brain structure that could not be represented by the model and suggest a way that this feature could be modelled or represented.Conclusion: As a class, discuss and reflect on the ability of scientific models (such as these models of the brain) to organise and understand observed phenomena. Note: This activity could also be adapted to create a model of a neuron.Part B: Analogies for brain structureAnalogies are often used in science to describe phenomena and concepts.

Teaching notesThis detailed example draws on the principles of PBL developed by the Buck Institute for Education. A PBL approach begins with an open-ended question, which is ideally provocative and engaging so that it captures students’ interest. Students investigate this question and brainstorm possible solutions, learning relevant content during the process. They then apply their learning in creative ways to produce, demonstrate or perform something, advocate for a policy or solution, or teach something to others, practising their communication skills in the process.Each student-centred project is broken down into three main stages, which can overlap in time frame:Inquire / discover / researchCreate / compose / produce Present / share / promoteOverall four questions relating to prejudice, discrimination, bullying and negative influences of the media are required for investigation. Teachers may provide these questions or develop these questions in conjunction with their students.A manageable way to tackle this task may be:determine the four questions to be investigated as a class student groups to share their groups’ learning with their class peers students to complete a ‘compare and contrast matrix’ for the four selected issues that addresses the following categories: factors that influence the behaviour involved, individual and community stakeholders involved, effect on individual and group behaviour, possible products and / or solutions. Assessment can include self- and peer-assessment questionnaires and a compare and contrast matrix. In this way the contribution of each student within any group is accounted for.Approximate time frames are proposed for each stage.Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant key science skills embedded in the task.PreparationStudents may need assistance in deconstructing the investigation question.Students should be able to develop and administer surveys. This may have previously been covered in class, or teachers may use this problem-based learning activity to develop these skills. Teachers should check survey items to ensure their appropriateness prior to the survey being publicly distributed. Teachers should work with students to: identify the style of items in their survey that will best answer the research question (for example, Likert-type scales, dichotomous or ordinal questions)develop items to be included in the survey that will best answer the research questiondevelop standardised procedures under which the survey will be administered take into account relevant ethical principles including informed consent, voluntary participation, withdrawal rights, confidentiality and debriefingdetermine the number of survey respondents required (for example, five respondents per student).Teachers could also discuss the necessary skills required to work well in a group, including perseverance and a positive attitude.Health and safety notesThere are no specific health and safety concerns associated with this activity. Procedure Stage 1: inquire / discover / research Lesson 1 plus some out-of-class time. Students:Choose an investigation question (IQ) that interests them personally – ideally they make their personal interest in it explicit by recording initial ideas in the logbook.Form teams of three to four people with some interest in the same IQ. The teacher may facilitate this.As a team, brainstorm what they do know and do not know about the problem / investigation question. What specific questions do they need to investigate further? Each student should keep evidence of the process in their logbooks.Consider how the IQ affects different people and places – research, identify and describe relevant individuals, stakeholders and community groups. What specific questions do they need to investigate further? Students need to keep evidence of the process in the logbooks and also keep a record of where they sourced the information in case they need to return to it later. Lesson 2 plus some out-of-class time. Students: Review the selected IQ and reframe / rewrite it if necessary to include specific parameters (such as particular places, stakeholders, countries etc.).Nominate valid sources, such as agencies, organisations or professionals in the field, who might be able to supply information to help them answer the specific questions they identified that require further investigation.Collect as much information as possible on the IQ by dividing up these tasks to individuals within their group. Remember to agree on a timeline for completion. This might include using methods such as: online/library research; surveys; interviews; photo and video documentation; experimental data; and meeting with a variety of experts with different viewpoints. As students research, it is critical they collect sufficient information that allows them to explain arguments for and against different stakeholders’ points of view. Each student should keep and share a careful log of their research – dates, times, sources, observations, summaries etc. Lesson 3. Students:As a group analyse the evidence collated during their field studies and create charts, graphs and other visual representations to understand their findings. Stage 2: create / compose / produce Lesson 4 plus some out-of-class time. Students:Based on their research, ask what specific product / solution they would like to create that addresses the IQ. Their task is to make public a strong, convincing argument to a real / authentic audience. Does the group want to design a website, plan a community event, improve an existing project / program, initiate an action-oriented campaign, make a persuasive presentation to relevant stakeholders? Or something else? Identify all the steps required to make this stage happen. Make contact with their real / authentic audience and present to them a very brief description of the intended product / solution and the rationales for the inquiry into the IQ. Students keep evidence of their contact in the logbooks. Lesson 5 plus some out of class time. Students:Create the product / solution and collect evidence of the process. Stage 3: present / share / promote Lesson 6 plus some out of class time. Students: Present the product / solution to class peers for initial review. The randomly selected class peers will complete an assessment questionnaire (based on criteria in a provided assessment rubric). Complete self- and team peer-assessment questionnaires.Deliver the product / solution to the real / authentic audience. Collect evidence of the process. Randomly selected audience members complete assessment questionnaires. Lesson 7Students complete a written ‘compare and contrast matrix’ for the selected question that addresses the following categories: factors that influence the behaviour involved, individual and community stakeholders involved, effect on individual and group behaviour, possible products and / or solutions.",

      "content": "On completion of this unit the student should be able to analyse how social cognition influences individuals to behave in specific ways and evaluate factors that influence individual and group behaviour.To achieve this outcome the student will draw on key knowledge outlined in Area of Study 1 and relevant key science skills on pages 12 and 13 of the study design.Examples of learning activitiesObtain a marketing survey and evaluate how it attempts to measure attitudes.Analyse a series of opinion polls published in the major metropolitan newspapers; consider how quantitative and qualitative data is used to support the purpose of the survey and consider the validity of the conclusions drawn from such data.Visit the Dax Collection (Kenneth Myer Building, Royal Parade, Melbourne) to investigate attitudes and stigma.Design, conduct and report on an investigation related to the prevalence of stereotypes associated with gender, culture, age or neurodiversity (for example, leisure interests, food preferences).As a class, develop and administer a 20-item survey that attempts to measure attitudes on a class-determined issue; report on the results of the survey, including a summary of how survey items were developed, selected and edited, and a survey conclusion.View episodes of Go back to where you came from (SBS television) to consider the role that person perception, attitudes and stereotypes may have in the development of prejudice and discrimination; alternatively, consider the influence that a series such as Go back to where you came from may have on individual and group behaviour, and the role that strategies such as cognitive interventions can play in changing individual attitudes and behaviours.View the film Coach Carter (2005); consider the attitudes displayed by key characters in terms of the tri-component model of attitudes as well as the role person perception, attitudes and stereotypes played in the key events that occurred in the film. Use project-based learning to address an issue relating to prejudice, discrimination, bullying and negative influences of media. (see Detailed example 1) View the film Coach Carter (2005); consider the attitudes displayed by key characters in terms of the tri-component model of attitudes as well as the role person perception, attitudes and stereotypes played in the key events that occurred in the film.Complete the Introduction to Disability Awareness course delivered through Disability Awareness.Develop a Likert-type scale and administer it to a range of age groups to investigate and report on the relationship between prejudice and age or another issue raised in the media.Use a spreadsheet application or a graphics calculator to create scatterplots of age and attitude scores to investigate variations in prejudice with age.Identify and classify the usefulness and limitations of stereotypes and person perception in decision-making and interpersonal interactions.Person perception and stereotyping greatly influence recruitment for employment and can lead to biased and unfair hiring. Create a process or system that recruiters could use to reduce bias.Watch an episode of ‘You can’t ask that’ on ABC iview; for example, facial differences or refugees (teacher to preview episodes to check appropriateness for cohort). While watching, identify your own personal perception of different presenters, and examples of stereotypes.Access the latest Australia Talks results (a survey which typically samples around 60 000 Australians about their attitudes to a range of issues). Discuss the purpose of the survey, study type, strengths and limitations of the sampling method and the usefulness of the findings in a real world context.Carry out fieldwork by undertaking a qualitative interview with a family member to understand times that their person perception has been inaccurate.Imagine you are a media consultant for a large fast food chain that has an image problem regarding an issue such as treatment of workers, environmental impacts or caged animals.

Identify ethical concepts raised by a campaign of this type.Reflect and discuss real-life examples of cognitive dissonance.Read Aesop’s fable of the The Fox and the Grapes and relate it to cognitive dissonance.Play a game in which students try to make their partner smile or laugh by coming up with the most ridiculous example of cognitive dissonance; for example, ‘I love making social media posts against large tech companies on my popular brand phone’.Investigate the Festinger and Carlsmith 1959 study on cognitive dissonance and present the findings as a flow chart diagram.Complete an online image search for ‘Festinger 1959 research results’ and convert the table information into an appropriate graph.In small groups, research a specific cognitive bias covering the following areas: description of bias, explanation of how it avoids cognitive dissonance, real world examples, summary of at least one previous study and suggestions for further study or research. Share this information with other students to complete a summary table.Carry out the Wason Rule Discovery Test as a class, followed by a discussion on the tendency to favour information that supports one’s own hypotheses.In terms of cognitive dissonance and cognitive biases, discuss why people may believe inaccurate news reporting or internet hoaxes.Analyse case studies of real life scams in terms of cognitive biases.As a class, consider the following riddle: ‘A father and son are in a horrible car crash that kills the dad. The son is rushed to the hospital; just as he’s about to go under the knife, the surgeon says, “I can’t operate—that boy is my son!”.’ Discuss possible explanations of the riddle; record and graph these explanations. Compare the class findings to Belle et al 2020 and discuss the concept of reproducibility.Produce a poster or mind map illustrating how cognitive biases interact with stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination.Suggest ways that people could become more aware of their own cognitive biases to make fairer and more reasoned decisions.Discuss the saying ‘trust your instincts’ in terms of the psychological theory of cognitive biases.Use examples to explain this quote by Leon Festinger: ‘When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance.’Design and run a two-part survey (cognition and behaviour) to measure people’s levels of cognitive dissonance on a current topic (for example: fast fashion, minimising food waste, saving money, animal welfare, time on social media, being sun smart, eating fresh fruit and vegetables, regular study).Use a PMI (pluses, minuses, interesting) chart to analyse the benefits and limitations of heuristics as mechanisms for decision-making and problem-solving.Role-play the use of heuristics in different decision-making scenarios (for example: buying a new mobile phone, working out where to go on holiday, deciding if a website is trustworthy).Heuristics are often used to manipulate the behaviour of consumers.

In addition, explore the case in terms of opinion, anecdote and evidence, and scientific and non-scientific ideas in light of contradictory information (see: NewScientist).Design, conduct and report on an investigation to explore the relationship between group size and social loafing in the context of meetings; the report should include commentary on the difficulties associated with judging social loafing.Identify whether a range of cultures would be classed as individualist or collectivist. Consider how different cultures would apply selected ethical concepts to given case studies and scenarios.Classify different Australian laws as being individualist or collectivist in nature.Carry out a class experiment to test the impact of social loafing. Students are randomly allocated to work individually or in a group of four to five students. They are given a task for a set time period and the productivity of each condition is compared. Tasks could include making paper planes or listing on separate pieces of paper things you would find in a city that begin with the letter T.Design a study to test if high social cohesion or individually identifiable tasks lessen social loafing.Provide examples of social loafing in different contexts, such as share-house, school project, workplace, sporting team, musical audience.Organise teamwork activities (for example: Lost at Sea, egg drop – Mindtools) as a starting point to discuss groupthink, groupshift and social loafing.Undertake online research to find real-life examples of groupthink. For one example, identify the factors that may have contributed to the groupthink and provide suggestions for how it could have been avoided.Create a blog that explores representations of social group influence (such as groupthink, groupshift, deindividuation, social loafing) in media formats such as movies, TV shows, books and music.Most local Councils livestream their meetings and have an archive of previous meetings available online.

      "content": "Detailed example 1Reflective blog – what influences a person’s sensations and perception of taste?AimThis task is staged over a few weeks of class time and involves students undertaking a series of practical activities as part of the regular teaching and learning program for Unit 2 Area of Study 1. Students create an online blog that includes a selection of relevant practical activities that enables them to compare the sensations and perceptions of taste and analyse the factors that may lead to the occurrence of perceptual distortions of taste.ProcedureFor each practical activity, students may be asked to formulate hypotheses or make predictions in relation to sensation and perception. They undertake investigations relating to human taste that involve the collection and recording of data, analysis of data and the methods used to draw evidence-based conclusions based on their investigations, and identification of associated scientific theories and models. In this example, the chosen format for communication of their scientific ideas is an online reflective blog (using a selected blogging website of choice such as Global2.vic.edu.au). The practical activities may involve the student conducting an experiment, being a participant in an experiment or acting as an observer in an experiment. The student may be involved in these activities individually, or as one student in a small group, or as a member of the whole class. The key knowledge to be addressed includes the processes involved in sensation and perception: taste as an example of human sensory systems; biological, psychological and social factors that influence gustatory perception; and the fallibility of gustatory perception systems.At the time of undertaking each practical activity, the student should record the details of the activity in their journal / on their blog. Students could be encouraged to take digital photographs to record the data as evidence of their participation in the practical activities and upload these under the relevant blog entries.Suggestions for practical activities that could be undertaken by students as part of this reflective learning journal / blog include:influence of colour intensity of different drinks on their perceived sweetnessinfluence of being blind folded on correct flavour identification of different flavoured drinksjudgment of perceived crispiness of food based on noisiness of packaginginfluence of temperature on perceived sweetnessinfluence of brand labels and no labels on perceived taste preferencechanges in salt sensitivity with ageinfluence of stress on ability to distinguish different flavours / tastesinfluence of the Delboeuf illusion on satietyinfluence of temperature on perceived bitternessinfluence of price on perceived taste preferenceeffect of nose-holding on the perception of taste.The student reflects upon the practical activities undertaken in terms of the overall research question. The teacher may decide whether to provide a set of guiding questions to assist student reflections or whether to allow students to make their own reflections based on a general question or related to a specific aspect of the area of study. The teacher should also determine when the reflections are to be completed, for example immediately after each practical activity, or after a series of practical activities, or in a block at the end of the area of study.",

      "content": "Detailed example 2Exploring factors influencing gustatory perception towards eating insectsAims To explore the factors influencing gustatory perception of eating edible insects.To develop secondary data skills through analysis of a contemporary Australian study.To develop primary data generation and analysis skills. BackgroundEating insects as a protein source is likely to increase in the future. These activities explore the social factors that may influence Australians’ willingness to try and incorporate insects as a food source. Step 1: Tuning inBrainstorm and discuss the reasons that eating insects as a protein source is likely to increase in the future. Identify and discuss students' reactions to the thought of eating insects. Classify these reactions as social or psychological. Step 2: Accessing a secondary source of information Access a secondary source of information on Australia’s willingness towards consuming edible insects. For example, the journal article by Hopkins et al (2021) Australians’ experience, barriers and willingness towards consuming edible insects as an emerging protein source. Note: this is an open source journal article so all sections are freely available. Note: while the article is quite long it is written in a fairly accessible manner.Depending on the cohort, students may read the whole article or break the article into sections with different students / groups focusing on a section each. Alternatively, you may provide a summary of the article or use a media article summarising the research such as this one on the The Conversation. Step 3: Interpreting and analysing the scientific investigationDepending on the cohort, decide on the best way to analyse the secondary source of information. Some suggestions follow:Using a graphic organiser such as a flow chart, summarise the research methodology and findings under the following headings: aim of research, study type, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion. This could be done by individual students, small groups or as a whole class.Carry out a scavenger style challenge for individuals or small groups of students to locate information and answer questions regarding the study aim, methodology, results and findings. Step 4: Classifying the gustatory factors Using a graphic organiser such as a mind map or table, summarise the biological, social and psychological factors identified in the article that may influence willingness to try insects. Note: this may present a good opportunity to connect and review topics covered in Area of Study 1 including attitudes, cognitive dissonance, use of heuristics for decision-making, conformity, and the influence of different media sources. Step 5: Carrying out primary research to replicate the investigation In small groups or as a class, design a method to replicate / modify / extend the research by surveying the local school community. This is a good opportunity to discuss the difference between primary and secondary research, qualitative and quantitative data, as well as the concept of reproducibility.You may choose to use / modify the original survey questions used by Hopkins et al (2021). These are available online as a link at the end of the report in Appendix A: supplementary data. It is suggested that you remove some or all of the screening questions to ensure that sensitive information is not gathered. Consider whether the research will be carried out using an online platform or in a paper-based format.The class will then collate the results and process the data obtained using appropriate mathematical calculations and units (such as the mean and percentage). Then it will be organised and presented in an appropriate format such as a table.The class findings can then be compared to the Hopkins et al (2021) research and any similarities / differences identified and discussed. This may present an opportunity to discuss errors, extraneous and confounding variables, uncertainty, reproducibility and external validity.",

      "content": "Students create an online blog that includes a selection of relevant practical activities that enables them to compare the sensations and perceptions of taste and analyse the factors that may lead to the occurrence of perceptual distortions of taste.ProcedureFor each practical activity, students may be asked to formulate hypotheses or make predictions in relation to sensation and perception. They undertake investigations relating to human taste that involve the collection and recording of data, analysis of data and the methods used to draw evidence-based conclusions based on their investigations, and identification of associated scientific theories and models. In this example, the chosen format for communication of their scientific ideas is an online reflective blog (using a selected blogging website of choice such as Global2.vic.edu.au). The practical activities may involve the student conducting an experiment, being a participant in an experiment or acting as an observer in an experiment. The student may be involved in these activities individually, or as one student in a small group, or as a member of the whole class. The key knowledge to be addressed includes the processes involved in sensation and perception: taste as an example of human sensory systems; biological, psychological and social factors that influence gustatory perception; and the fallibility of gustatory perception systems.At the time of undertaking each practical activity, the student should record the details of the activity in their journal / on their blog. Students could be encouraged to take digital photographs to record the data as evidence of their participation in the practical activities and upload these under the relevant blog entries.Suggestions for practical activities that could be undertaken by students as part of this reflective learning journal / blog include:influence of colour intensity of different drinks on their perceived sweetnessinfluence of being blind folded on correct flavour identification of different flavoured drinksjudgment of perceived crispiness of food based on noisiness of packaginginfluence of temperature on perceived sweetnessinfluence of brand labels and no labels on perceived taste preferencechanges in salt sensitivity with ageinfluence of stress on ability to distinguish different flavours / tastesinfluence of the Delboeuf illusion on satietyinfluence of temperature on perceived bitternessinfluence of price on perceived taste preferenceeffect of nose-holding on the perception of taste.The student reflects upon the practical activities undertaken in terms of the overall research question. The teacher may decide whether to provide a set of guiding questions to assist student reflections or whether to allow students to make their own reflections based on a general question or related to a specific aspect of the area of study. The teacher should also determine when the reflections are to be completed, for example immediately after each practical activity, or after a series of practical activities, or in a block at the end of the area of study.

      "content": "Detailed example 2Stress in JapanAimsTo investigate the Japanese tsunami of 2011 and its ongoing effects as a major source of stress for the Japanese population.To examine the nature of scientific evidence.Background information for teachersJapan, being geologically located at the nexus of four tectonic plates, experiences more than 1,500 seismic events each year, including at least two 5.0 magnitude or higher earthquakes. As a result, between 1608 and 1945 Tokyo was destroyed and rebuilt, on average, once every five years. On 11 March 2011, a magnitude-9 earthquake shook northeastern Japan, also creating a devastating tsunami. The effects of this earthquake were felt globally and tsunami debris continues to wash up as far away as in North America. Residents are still recovering from the disaster. Students are provided with the following data collected by an American reporter. Some data comes from secondary sources, such as previous studies and government-based statistics and some has been collected through interviews with Japanese residents (primary data): The disaster has caused an increase in suicides, PTSD, and stress-related physical ailments like cardiovascular disease. In particular, the number of stress-related deaths (1,656) reported by the Japanese government, has topped deaths directly caused by the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown combined. In 2010, NYU sociologist Florencia Torche studied the impact of the 2008 Chilean earthquake on mothers with infants then in utero. She found the heightened levels of cortisol in mothers of infants born in the first trimester of the quake led to lower birth weights, earlier birth rates, and increased cortisol levels in their children. Those born in earthquake areas are, after 14 years, at a cognitive and physical disadvantage: They performed worse in school and didn’t boast as strong a stature. Torche’s findings show that the effect of an earthquake ‘can exist over the individual’s entire life—even across generations’.There is some evidence that the Japanese are being similarly affected. Japanese people of all ages are more likely to carry a gene that predisposes them to react more strongly to stressful events than people outside of Japan. In a 2008 study, Japanese infants were found to react to the pain of being inoculated with more cortisol than American infants did, though they also whined less than the Americans.Stress could also explain Japan’s famously low birth rates: exposure to stressful environments is correlated with lower sperm counts, ovulation issues, and other issues of reproductive functioning. High levels of chronic stress and cortisol decrease sex drives in women, and in Japan, a full 45 per cent of women reported they were ‘not interested in sexual contact’—and more than 25 per cent of Japanese men feel the same way. ‘The Japanese talk about stress a whole lot less than Americans talk about stress,’ says Bill Tsutsui, a Japanese-American historian. ‘And yet, to me, Japanese society is the most stressful on the planet.’ Even though only 2.5 per cent of Japanese people are diagnosed with depression at any given time, compared with 6.7 per cent of Americans, the suicide rate among Japanese people is 20.1 per 100,000, compared to 12.6 for Americans.The stigma surrounding mental health means that for many, the idea of reporting stress is more stressful than simply living—or dying—with it. ‘The stress of social interaction has caused a flight from human intimacy. You cannot open your mouth to say a word without considering your relationship with the people around you—your place in the hierarchy. And if you say something wrong you risk grievously offending people.’ Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant key science skills embedded in the task.Activity 1: Stress as a psychobiological processStudents can work in small groups to read and complete a simple summary of the psychobiological aspects of the evidence provided in a table:Psychological Factors / ExamplesBiological Factors / Examples Discussion questions and report writing in logbookA series of four to eight graded questions could be set for students to answer in their logbook, for example: Connect: Identify any direct links between biological and psychological examples of stress provided in the evidence. Explain: Why would the 2011 Tsunami be considered a major stressor? Why would it also be considered a catastrophe? Why would it be categorised as distress? Apply: Using your understanding of Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome, explain how the Japanese people would have progressed through the relevant stages. Be sure to use any relevant evidence and reference the role of cortisol. Using your understanding of Lazarus and Folkman’s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, explain the psychological process of stress that the Japanese people would have gone through. Propose: Using your understanding of context-specific effectiveness and coping flexibility, suggest some ongoing strategies that would help the Japanese people reduce the symptoms of their ongoing stress.Activity 2: Evaluation of data Students could be asked to write an extended response in which they are required to critically evaluate the evidence provided in Activity 1 by considering all or some of the following dot points:The type(s) of data obtained (qualitative versus quantitative)The reliability and validity of the data obtainedInvestigative procedures (interview) used to obtain the dataPossible sources of bias within the dataAny distinctions that can be made between scientific and non-scientific ideas.",

Each student then uses their own outline to fill in each division of the human nervous system, using a different colour for each division; labels should be added to indicate the function of each of the divisions.Construct a flow chart explaining how the different divisions of the nervous system respond to, integrate and coordinate, when a person does a particular action; for example, picks up a hot cup of coffee, pats a dog, catches a ball.Work in pairs to investigate human reflexes: knee-jerk reflex (lightly strike the knee just below the knee-cap of someone sitting down with legs crossed to observe the leg kick up); pilo-motor reflex (tickle the back of the neck to observe the hairs stand on end); plantar reflex (lightly scratch the outer edge of the sole of the foot and observe toes flexing).Complete a Venn diagram outlining the similarities and differences between conscious and unconscious responses.Conduct controlled experiments into reflex actions; for example, the reaction time of a human nerve-controlled reaction. See Backyard Brains for a lesson plan.Create a folio of a range of related experiments and activities exploring the nervous system as outlined in 'Neuroscience for Kids’.Work in pairs to formulate a hypothesis and investigate experimentally the factors that affect reaction times in catching a dropped ruler; for example, gender, age, level of alertness, before or after eating.

Use the clip as a stimulus to discuss the crucial role of the spinal cord, the complexity of processing and coordinating with sensory stimuli, and the potential promises and perils of new technologies. Demonstrate the speed of neural transmission using a chain of students as a model. (see Detailed example 1) Compare the roles of dopamine and GABA in Parkinson’s disease.Use lollies (or different shaped dried pasta) to construct a model of a synapse to demonstrate the role of neurotransmitters in the transmission of neural information.Create a dramatisation of the transmission of neural information across the synapse, with students playing the role of different parts of the neuron and synapse.Create a Venn diagram to compare and contrast neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.Produce a cartoon or other visual sequence format to illustrate the role of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.Investigate how SSRIs can be used to treat mood disorders.

Explain how a model of the ‘gut-brain axis’ assists in understanding the findings of this study. In particular, how has the finding of a correlation between psychological and biological symptoms led to clinical trials to investigate a causal relationship.Discuss Hans Selye’s quote, ‘Every stress leaves an indelible scar, and the organism pays for its survival after a stressful situation by becoming a little older’ in relation to his General Adaptation Syndrome as a model that explains the stress response.Practise drawing and labelling a diagram of the model from memory.Respond to questions about the General Adaptation Syndrome such as: What question was Hans Selye trying to answer with the GAS model? To what extent does the model answer that question? What is the overall explanatory power, and usefulness, of the model for humans in the real world? Do you think the GAS model can be used in conjunction with the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping or are they opposed to one another?Using the GAS model, annotate an example of a stressful experience (this could be from personal experience such as preparing for four SACs in one week or from a fictional situation such as a character from a favourite television show or movie) by indicating what happened physiologically at each stage (e.g. heart rate increased when I saw the calendar, cortisol continued to be released while I did revision). In a different colour pen, annotate the psychological components of the event (e.g. I was worrying about getting good grades, I was thinking positively about my preparation).Use a ‘PMI (plus-minus-interesting) Chart’ to summarise the stages of primary and secondary appraisal according to Lazarus & Folkman’s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping.Prepare a PowerPoint presentation, using examples from personal experience, to illustrate the application of primary and secondary appraisal.Using the melody of your favourite song, write new lyrics to it that explain the stages of the Transactional Model.Use a Venn diagram to compare the explanatory power of The General Adaptation Syndrome and The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping.Conduct a survey to find whether there is a relationship between exercise habits and self-perceived levels of stress.Design and perform an investigation to test the statement that people who self-identify as being stressed also tend to eat more food, and food that is higher in carbohydrates, than people who self-identify as being less stressed. Explain how this investigation could be modified to test the statement that ‘people who secrete higher levels of cortisol in response to stress also tend to eat more food and food that is higher in carbohydrates than people who secrete lower levels of cortisol in response to stress’. Identify the relationship between these two different investigations.Construct a table that identifies specific approach and avoidance strategies for coping with stress, with reference to Roth & Cohen’s (1986) model of approach and avoidance coping strategies.As a class, create a short survey or scale that could be used to measure coping flexibility.Identify the potential benefits and limitations of approach and avoidance strategies in coping with stress and improving mental wellbeing. Consider both short-term and long-term consequences for each strategy.Consult a pamphlet or brochure (created by teacher) outlining novel or unique strategies that students could use to reduce their level of stress during Year 12, considering context-specific effectiveness and coping flexibility.Conduct a short survey to create a list of all the coping strategies students, friends and family members may use in response to stressful situations. Classify these as approach / avoidance and whether they demonstrate context-specific effectiveness or coping flexibility.Many commonly used stress scales were developed in America with a sample of predominantly white participants. Discuss the appropriateness and application to an Australian context.Detailed example 1Conduct a simulation activity demonstrating the speed of neural transmissionBackgroundThe speed of neural transmission is estimated to be 70–120 meters per second (m / s).

Students are required to collect data, use evidence and transfer their findings to explain this relationship.Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant key science skills embedded in the task.Pre-activity preparationThe task follows class work on the importance of sleep, circadian and ultradian rhythms, patterns of sleep and theories of its purpose. A review of self-reports and the use of quantitative data may also be required. ProcedureEach class member surveys at least one participant in each of the age groups.Students should approach each potential participant and say ‘I am a VCE student doing a survey on sleep patterns as a learning activity; would you mind if I ask you a few short questions? This survey is entirely anonymous’. Note: if the participant is an infant or a child, the students will need to ask the participant’s parent this question.If the participant indicates a willingness to take part, ask ‘Could you tell me which of these age groups applies to you? 0–2, 3–12, 13–18, 21–64, 65+.’ Note: if the participant is an infant or a child, the students will need to ask the participant’s parent this question.Students then record the age group of the participant and ask: ‘For each of these questions, could you think back and give the average figure for the past week?

It would be best carried out at the conclusion of the area of study. Students are provided with a scenario and a set of data and they answer a series of discussion questions. Example of a scenario with generated primary dataAmara is a university psychology student who conducted a study to test the influence of mobile phone use on melatonin levels. She recruited seven other university psychology students to take part in the study, ensuring that none of them were on melatonin medication or supplements. After reading the participant information sheet about the specific purposes of the study and signing a consent form, the participants were asked to record the number of hours spent on their phone after 5pm each night for one week. Participants who on average used their phones for more than 150 minutes per evening were categorised as the high user group. Those who used their phone on average for less than 150 minutes per evening were categorised as the low user group.When designing the study Amara had a choice of two different branded melatonin test kits. To determine the most precise test she repeated each test herself three times within a ten-minute period around midnight on a single night. The results were as follows: Table 1: Results of Amara’s testing of the two different branded melatonin test kits at midnight Test 1Test 2Test 3Melatonin Testing Kit A 91 85 95Melatonin Testing Kit B 80 81 79 The expected melatonin range based on healthy population studies are:Time Melatonin range pg / mLMelatonin target range pg / mLMidnight 40–150956–8am5 Once Amara had determined which brand of test kit to use, each participant was provided with one melatonin test kit and given the following instructions: Two saliva specimens are to be collected on Wednesday night.

The task requires students to access a small number of participants of different ages (for example: an infant, a child, an adolescent, an adult and an elderly person). Students are required to collect data, use evidence and transfer their findings to explain this relationship.Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant key science skills embedded in the task.Pre-activity preparationThe task follows class work on the importance of sleep, circadian and ultradian rhythms, patterns of sleep and theories of its purpose. A review of self-reports and the use of quantitative data may also be required. ProcedureEach class member surveys at least one participant in each of the age groups.Students should approach each potential participant and say ‘I am a VCE student doing a survey on sleep patterns as a learning activity; would you mind if I ask you a few short questions? This survey is entirely anonymous’. Note: if the participant is an infant or a child, the students will need to ask the participant’s parent this question.If the participant indicates a willingness to take part, ask ‘Could you tell me which of these age groups applies to you? 0–2, 3–12, 13–18, 21–64, 65+.’ Note: if the participant is an infant or a child, the students will need to ask the participant’s parent this question.Students then record the age group of the participant and ask: ‘For each of these questions, could you think back and give the average figure for the past week?

They organise, present and interpret the data using an appropriate table or graph.Discussion questions and report writing in logbookA series of four to six graded questions that address the data and the implications of the relationship between the total amount of sleep and patterns of sleep across the lifespan should be set for students to answer in their logbook, for example: Identify: What are the dependent and independent variables in your investigation? Explain: According to your data, how does the pattern of sleep change across the lifespan? Evaluate: Discuss any potential extraneous variables and how they have affected the data on sleep gathered? Suggest future improvements to address these if the investigation was to be repeated. Propose: What further data could be gathered to investigate how patterns of sleep change across the lifespan? Outline a method for a further testing. Teaching notesIt is important that students understand how to collate the data and perform any calculations. Some students may not, and teachers should lead students when collating the data and demonstrate some calculations; for example, the mean values for the first age group (infants) in the table. Further investigation gathering qualitative data about the quality of sleep, dysomnias and parasomnias could also be conducted.

Students are presented with a case study of an individual with specific phobia (refer to the case study in the learning activities related to Vicky’s phobia of dandelions as a further example to the case of Don’s claustrophobia provided below) that they are required to analyse.Science skillsTeachers should identify and inform students of the relevant key science skills embedded in the task.Activity 1: Case study scenarioStudents are provided with a case study of a person who has a specific phobia. For example:‘Donald (Don) is a 59-year-old male who works in a state government office as an accountant. He enjoys his work and the people he works with. He has worked for the government in this position, or similar positions, for the last 25 years. His salary is quite good and he has excellent benefits; however, recently he has been seriously considering retirement. In fact, he and his wife Barb have been talking about going on a road trip in their campervan when he does. Don’s main reason for retiring, though, is that the whole accounting department has recently been consolidated from several different locations. This had been done to improve efficiency. For Don, the problem with this consolidation is that he has a significant fear of small, enclosed spaces such as elevators (claustrophobia). So, when his office first moved, Don tried to use the stairs to get to his office but he found this very difficult because of his arthritic left knee. The combination of his fear and his physical problem led to him beginning to dislike going to work. So much so that he would ask Barb to call in ‘sick’ for him, which she became really concerned about. Despite recognising that his fear is irrational and out of proportion to the actual dangers involved in elevator travel, Don is still unable to stop avoiding travelling on elevators. In fact, Don’s claustrophobia is something he has suffered from for a very long time. It seems his problems began when he was a young child when his older brother locked him in his bedroom closet. It was done as a prank, but Don became extremely fearful, his heart was racing and he felt out of breath. He had what he now recognises as being a panic attack. Despite pounding on the door and begging to be let out, his brother only released him an hour later. Ever since that event he remembers avoiding enclosed spaces of all types and even as a teenager he had to have a light on in his bedroom at night.’In small groups, students are provided a blank version of a BPS table and asked to identify any contributing factors in relation to the development of the specific phobia in the case study.The Biopsychosocial (BPS) approachBiological factorsPsychological factorsSocial factorsActivity 2: Discussion questions Contributing FactorsDetermine where you think the individual in the case study sits on the mental health continuum. Justify your placement, based on your understanding of the distinction between stress, phobia and anxiety. Choose one relevant biological contributing factor to the individual’s phobia and discuss its potential role in the development of their phobia. Explain the role of classical conditioning in precipitating the individual’s phobia. Discuss the role of operant conditioning in perpetuating the individual’s phobia. Identify and explain any specific environmental triggers of the individual’s phobia. Interventions and / or ManagementSuggest a biological intervention and explain how it might benefit the individual. Explain how CBT could be used as a psychological management intervention for the individual. Using the language of classical conditioning, explain the process that would be involved in using systematic desensitisation as a psychological intervention for the individual. Discuss the importance of involving the individual’s family / supporters as a part of their therapy. Teaching notesIt is important that students gain practice at applying the BPS to varying mental health case studies or scenarios. Initially, students may need guidance and could benefit from completing an initial analysis of a case study as a class or in small groups.",

Depending on the school context, student cohort and individual teacher competency, student may be guided to consider other sections and information included in the report, provided that cultural safety can be supported and maintained at all times. Suggested activities using Balit Murrup: Aboriginal social and emotional wellbeing framework 2017–2027 Activity 1: Graphic organiser of key conceptsReferring to the background information available at the Department of Health, as well as pages 1 and 8 of the framework, outline the development and vision of Balit Murrup. Using pages 24, 26 and 27 of the framework, students create a graphic organiser (for example, wheel diagram, bubble map, cluster diagram) to describe and give examples of the elements of social and emotional wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Add an image or icon for each element to act as a mnemonic cue. Note: The VCE Psychology Study Design only focuses on the influence of cultural determinants on social and emotional wellbeing. The other three determinants (social, political, historical) included in the outer ring of Figure 1 on page 24 are beyond the scope of the VCE Psychology Study Design. Depending on the teacher and student cohort, they may be considered for greater contextual understanding.Activity 2: Connecting ideasThe framework ‘…embeds Aboriginal self-determination as the core principle to drive actions to improve the social and emotional wellbeing, resilience and mental health of Aboriginal people, families and communities…’ (Department of Health, 2021). Ask students to describe the meaning of self-determination and identify ways that self-determination enable and support social and emotional wellbeing (for example, see pages 8 and 14).Provide students with a copy of ‘Appendix 2: Gayaa Dhuwi (Proud Spirit) Declaration’ (page 51). Annotate and discuss in small groups how the core principle of self-determination is reflected in the Declaration.Consider how the dimensions ‘connection to culture’, ‘connection to land’ and ‘connection to spirituality’ (page 27) support and enable cultural continuity. Create a graphic organiser that identifies how cultural continuity and self-determination, as cultural determinants, are integral for the maintenance of wellbeing of Aboriginal Victorians.Detailed exampleCase study analysis of the development and management of specific phobiaIntroductionAt this stage, students would have completed the following areas of the course: defining mental wellbeing, application of a biopsychosocial approach to explain specific phobia. Students are presented with a case study of an individual with specific phobia (refer to the case study in the learning activities related to Vicky’s phobia of dandelions as a further example to the case of Don’s claustrophobia provided below) that they are required to analyse.",

      "content": "Detailed exampleScaffolding student designed scientific investigationsThe type of guidance and the amount of support students will need to complete the Outcome 3 Scientific Investigation will vary greatly. Depending on your cohort, students may have already completed similar tasks and have a strong understanding of the scientific investigation process and the requirements of the scientific poster. Alternatively, you may have students who bring limited skills and knowledge or are completely new to the subject.Early on in the year, one of the first things to do is estimate the knowledge and skills students currently have, both with and without guidance (their zone of proximal development). Based on this teachers can establish areas of focus (for example, formulating hypotheses or data analysis) and then review the unit to identify where such areas can be purposefully introduced. Then a series of collaborative learning activities, tools and reference resources can be developed to build up skills and knowledge. As student skill level increases the guidance can be gradually withdrawn.A scaffolded approach may include:Using a range of tools for students to access when developing knowledge and skillsFor example: a template for writing hypotheses, a table to compare the advantages and limitations of different research designs, informed consent template, poster with some sections pre-populated as a cloze activityUsing a range of reference resourcesFor example: de-identified previous student posters, teacher created poster examples, single-page guide to descriptive statistics, guide to accessing secondary information including useful websites and advanced google searching tools, guide to reading and interpreting journal articlesCreating checklists with the classFor example: essential features of a hypothesis, things to consider when determining validity, graph and table requirements (for example, heading, axis labelled)Teacher modelling a task, or sub-tasks, and then students working with teacher and each other to become more skilled For example: teacher modelling how to turn a question into a hypothesis and then students working with each other and then individually to complete the same task.For example: following a short classroom-based activity or experiment the teacher models how to complete data analysis such as identifying outliers, working out the mean, thinking aloud through the most appropriate way to present data and then completing a table or graph.For example: teacher modelling how to read and interpret journal articles (for example, identify the specific question the research was trying to answer, scan the paper, focus on the abstract for a succinct summary, draw a diagram of the method).Moving from structured teacher-led investigations to student-centered open investigationsInitially a teacher-led inquiry is carried out within the classroom and students complete a poster template with some sections pre-populated as a cloze activity (for example, experiment demonstrating the speed of neural transmission).The next step may involve a structured inquiry with the teacher presenting a question and providing a prescribed procedure for the class to carry out. Students sample participants outside the classroom and then collate results before completing a poster template with reduced guidance (for example, a study to investigate the question ‘Does regular consumption of fermented foods influence stress levels?’).The next step may involve a guided inquiry whereby the teacher chooses the question for investigation and the students work in one large group, or several small groups, to work with the teacher to decide how to proceed with the investigation. They may then complete the logbook entries and poster template with little, if any, guidance.Finally, the students may carry out an open inquiry that begins with a student’s question, followed by the student (or groups of students) designing and conducting an investigation or experiment and communicating results.",

      "content": "On completion of this unit the student should be able to design and conduct a scientific investigation related to mental processes and psychological functioning, and present an aim, methodology and method, results, discussion and conclusion in a scientific poster. To achieve this outcome the student will draw on key knowledge outlined in Area of Study 3 and the related key science skills on pages 12 and 13 of the study design. Examples of learning activities Develop skills in designing and conducting a scientific investigation related to mental process and psychological functioning, presenting findings in a scientific poster. (see Detailed example) Discuss the importance of developing investigable questions for scientific investigation in light of Albert Einstein’s quote: ‘The important thing is not to stop questioning’, Robert Half’s quote: ‘Asking the right questions takes as much skill as giving the right answers’ and Nancy Willard’s quote: ‘Sometimes questions are more important than the answers’.Comment, in terms of the nature of science, on Bill Gaede’s quote: ‘Science is not about making predictions or performing experiments. Science is about explaining’.Design and conduct investigations to answer the following questions: Does using a reward when learning a new task affect learning?Does using a punishment when learning a new task affect learning?Does practice improve performance?How does using a mobile phone affect dance moves?How distracting are distractions?Devise an inquiry to investigate the effectiveness of different learning techniques (summarisation, highlighting or underlining, keyword mnemonic, elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, imagery for text, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, interleaved practice) based on the work of Dunlosky et al (2013.Design and undertake an experiment to determine whether applause improves human or other animal performance; identify how the ethical issues associated with the experiment can be resolved.Design and conduct an experiment to determine whether experiences or incidents need to have a strong emotional component to be placed and stored as part of long-term memory.Apply coupled inquiry to develop and investigate questions related to memory for example: Does using labels assist in the retention and recall of information?What factors affect encoding and retrieval of information when playing the ‘Rumour Game’?How important are cues in memory?Design and conduct controlled experiments to determine whether: highlighting words or writing them down increases their recollectionrecall of information is affected by the time of day at which information is learntdifferent types of background music affect memorisation skills of studentseating breakfast improves memoryeating particular foods improves memorypeople can more easily remember a series of numbers, words, patterns or coloursusing a different type of font for a set of words improves their recallusing different coloured paper on which words are written improves their recall.Formulate hypotheses; then plan and undertake investigations to determine whether particular scents (lavender, rose, chocolate, peppermint, vanilla, white musk, lavender and citrus) increase capacity to remember a list of words. Extend the investigations to determine whether there is a gender or age difference in the capacity to remember words when subjected to different scents. Suggest a physiological mechanism or neural pathway whereby particular scents could increase a person’s capacity to improve their memory.Design and conduct an investigation to determine which method of information delivery (audio, visual, mnemonic, repetition, note-taking, cramming, use of flashcards, reading words aloud) is more effectively remembered, both in the short-term and after a longer period.Formulate a hypothesis and undertake an investigation to determine whether text colour affects how well information is recalled.Devise and undertake an investigation to determine whether certain types of animal pets (dogs, cats, mice, fish, birds) provide greater physical (for example, blood pressure) and mental health (for example, performance on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire) benefits to their owners. Explain how variables were controlled and identify extraneous and confounding variables that may affect investigation conclusions.Design an investigation to determine whether the ‘earworm effect’ (songs that get stuck in your head) is real. Modify an experimental design to investigate the aspects of songs that may cause the ‘earworm effect’.Access the research reported at dailymail.co.uk, news.com.au or sciencedaily.com to develop and test an investigable question related to the relationships between sleep and memory, or sleep and wellbeing.Design and conduct an investigation to determine whether binaural music is effective as a stress management technique (or as a means to induce faster sleep onset).Visit the website Spurious Correlations to discuss the key concept that correlation does not equal causation.Use a Venn diagram to distinguish between extraneous and confounding variables.A variable is considered to be confounding when it provides an alternative explanation to results; that is, an alternative explanation for the relationship between the IV and DV. This threatens the internal validity of a study. Apply this information to research examples, such as the following: In a study looking at the effectiveness of mnemonic techniques on long-term memory one group learns about acronyms and acrostics through an interactive online session. Another group learns about the method of loci through a face-to-face small group discussion. Both groups are then provided with a list of terms to memorise using their technique. Over the next few weeks their long-term memory is tested at several points.For the following scenarios brainstorm possible techniques for primary quantitative data generation; then discuss the challenge that exists in measuring subjective experiences: stress levelssleep qualitycognitive developmentattitude towards electric vehiclesmental wellbeing.Annotate target board images to visually represent the concepts of accuracy and precision.Test heart rate via a number of different means (for example, fingers on wrist, fingers on neck, heart rate monitors). Compare the results as a basis for discussing the concepts of accuracy, precision, random errors, systematic errors, personal errors and reproducibility.Use a Venn diagram to distinguish between the concepts of accuracy and precision.Use a Venn diagram to distinguish between the concepts of reproducibility and repeatability.As a class, create a set of guidelines to ensure that health, safety and ethical guidelines are met when carrying out practical research activities.Formulate a hypothesis and design an experiment to test whether people can pay attention to two things at the same time.Design and conduct an experiment to test the claim that watching goldfish has a calming effect on people.Devise an inquiry to test the statement that singing is an effective form of stress release.Develop a hypothesis and undertake an investigation to determine whether there is a relationship between colour and mood.Devise an inquiry to determine whether people display similar emotional responses to subject matter presented in different forms; for example: photograph, painting, sketch, description, poetry, song.Formulate a hypothesis and design an experiment to test whether chewing gum: improves concentration; decreases stress.Provided with a set of data to visually recognise and identify outliers, discuss how these outliers would affect the validity of research and ways to manage through statistical analysis.Bennett, Baird, Miller, and George (2009) conducted an fMRI on the brain of a dead salmon and activity was detected in the brain cavity. Discuss this research in terms of uncertainty and validity.Hold a class discussion about the purpose of logbooks in psychology research.Make a checklist of features that should be part of a scientific logbook (for example, dated and chronological).Identify some of the assumptions or limitations of the following data generation techniques: Elite athletes self-rating their fitness levelsUsing heart rate as a measure of stressUsing observation to judge a person's level of empathyUsing students’ English school reports to assess suitability for a tradeAsking managers to report on their own decision-making rationale during recruitment.Access the research report on phobia’s effect on the perception of a feared object and evaluate the investigation methodology including any ethical implications. Design a different way to test the idea that the more afraid a person is of a spider, the bigger that individual perceives the spider to be.Access a report of research undertaken related to a possible correlation between time spent outdoors and reduced incidence of high blood pressure and depression ​and identify and evaluate the limitations of the research study, including a discussion of repeatability, reproducibility and validity. Suggest modifications to the research methodology to improve the validity of the conclusions drawn from the results.Make a checklist of things to consider when assessing the validity of a piece of psychological research.Comment, in terms of the importance of scientific communication, on Anthony Hewish’s quote: ‘I believe scientists have a duty to share the excitement and pleasure of their work with the general public, and I enjoy the challenge of presenting difficult ideas in an understandable way’.Carry out a web search for ‘poor data representations’. Look at several sites and create a list of important considerations when representing data visually (for example, always clearly label each axis).Download and print prepared scientific posters (for example, from the University of Texas at Austin website. Work in groups and use a provided set of criteria to evaluate investigation aims, methodologies, data presentation, conclusions and effectiveness of scientific communication for each poster.Hold small-group discussions in class to identify the strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement of a range of scientific posters; for example, those found at the University of Texas at Austin website. Collate and reflect on class results and provided online evaluations to develop a set of ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’ for constructing a scientific poster. Debate the topic: ‘It is more important, in presentations, to impress than to inform’.Scientific posters are typically used at large conferences. With this in mind, discuss why poster conventions, word brevity and clear data analysis in graphs / tables is important.Do a web search for ‘scientific poster’ images. Identify similarities in headings, layout and content. Identify differences in the posters and consider the features that enhance effective communication.When looking at studies from a textbook or other sources, write a communication statement reporting the key finding of the investigation as a one-sentence summary (as per the scientific poster requirement). Discuss the real-life implications of theories and models by discussing questions such as: For whom are these findings most relevant? How can these findings be used to advance society? Is there the potential for these findings to be applied in an unjust manner?Detailed exampleScaffolding student designed scientific investigationsThe type of guidance and the amount of support students will need to complete the Outcome 3 Scientific Investigation will vary greatly.

      "task": "The report should be preceded by a scientific investigation that has been fully and / or partially completed under supervision and that has been recorded in students’ logbooks. The logbook may then be used for reference by students when producing the report in a format determined by the teacher. Reports may take any form as deemed appropriate by the teacher, and may include an oral presentation, presentation of results with student analysis and discussion, a response to an overarching question or set of structured questions, full or partial practical reports that include an abstract, aim, hypothesis, method, results, discussion, conclusion and references or a scientific poster. Although scientific investigations may be conducted individually, in small groups or as a class, the report must be completed individually. If a partial report is completed, teachers and students may negotiate report sections pertinent to the investigation question that will be completed individually and assessed. Assessment may also be completed in stages; for example, investigation design, analysis and evaluation of the results, construction of the chosen report format."
