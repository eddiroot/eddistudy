      "abbreviation": "U1AOS1",
      "description": "In this area of study, students study light using the wave model and thermal energy using a particle model forming an understanding of the fundamental physics ideas of reflection, refraction and dispersion. They use these to understand observations made of the world such as mirages and rainbows. They investigate energy transfers and explore how light and thermal energy relate to one another. They apply light ideas to explain how light is used through optical fibres in communication, and how physics is used to inform global warming and climate change. On completion of this unit the student should be able to model, investigate and evaluate the wave-like nature of light, thermal energy and the emission and absorption of light by matter."

They learn about the properties of the radiation from the nucleus and the effects of this radiation on human cells and tissues and apply this understanding to the use of radioisotopes in medical therapy. Students explore the transfer of energy from the nucleus through the processes of fission and fusion and apply these ideas to evaluate the viability of nuclear energy as an energy source for Australia."

      "description": "Modelling is a useful tool in developing concepts that explain physical phenomena that cannot be directly observed. In this area of study, students develop conceptual models to analyse electrical phenomena and undertake practical investigations of circuit components. Concepts of electrical safety are developed through the study of safety mechanisms and the effect of current on humans. Students apply and critically assess mathematical models during experimental investigations of DC circuits. They explore electrical safety and the use of transducers to transfer energy in common devices. On completion of this unit the student should be able to investigate and apply a basic DC circuit model to simple battery-operated devices and household electrical systems, apply mathematical models to analyse circuits, and describe the safe and effective use of electricity by individuals and the community."

They consider the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on motion and investigate the translational and rotational forces on static structures. Students apply mathematical models during experimental investigations of motion, and apply their understanding of motion and force through a case study. On completion of this unit the student should be able to investigate, analyse, mathematically model and apply force, energy and motion."

They select from eighteen options, explore the related physics and use this physics to form a stance, opinion or solution to a contemporary societal issue or application. In their explorations, a range of investigation methodologies may be used by students.

In this area of study, students adapt or design and then conduct a scientific investigation to generate appropriate primary qualitative and/or quantitative data, organise and interpret the data, and reach and evaluate a conclusion in response to the research question. Research questions may relate to different scientific methodologies that involve the generation of primary data, controlled experiments, fieldwork, correlational studies, classification and identification, modelling, and the development of a product, process or system. Students may extend their knowledge and skills related to understanding motion by designing and undertaking investigations such as, ‘What are the energy transformations during a theme park ride?’, ‘What are the forces experienced by a netballer’s ankle?’, ‘Is momentum conserved in a football tackle?’ and ‘What is the optimal design of the lightest capsule that is able to prevent an egg breaking during a drop?’. Video analysis can be used to investigate questions such as, ‘Is kinetic energy conserved in a pole vault?’. Questions may be used as a starting point for the investigation, such as ‘Does the shape of the cornea or the material of the lens have a greater effect on refraction?’, ‘How do the structures of winged seeds affect their dispersal?’ and ‘How do buttresses affect the stability of a church?’, or further questions may be posed that have arisen from the options in Unit 2, Area of Study 2. The student-adapted or student-designed scientific investigation relates to knowledge and skills developed in Area of Study 1 and/or Area of Study 2."
