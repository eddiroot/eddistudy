They use double entry accounting to record data and generate accounting information in the form of accounting reports and graphical representations. This information is used to assist the owner in making informed decisions about the operation of the business. Students should also consider strategies to improve the performance of the business, taking into account the relevant ethical considerations. On completion of this unit the student should be able to record financial data using a double entry system; explain the role of the General Journal, General Ledger and inventory cards in the recording process; and describe, discuss and analyse various aspects of accounting reports and the accounting system, including ethical considerations. To achieve this outcome, the student will draw on key knowledge and key skills outlined in Area of Study 1. the accounting assumptions and qualitative characteristics, as applicable documents used by a business to record financial transactions"

Students develop their understanding of the accounting processes and complete those processes that are applicable to the end of a reporting period for a trading business. They apply the accrual method of accounting to the preparation of accounting reports and draw a distinction between cash and profit, considering the implications of these differences when using reports to make decisions. Students undertake an analysis of accounting reports and interpret the information, taking into account relevant ethical considerations, in order to evaluate the performance of the business.

They consider the effects of balance day adjustments on the accounting reports, and the implications of using alternative methods of depreciation on the accounting reports and on the performance of the business. They also examine ethical considerations that may affect the recording and reporting of financial data and the effects of these on business performance.

Students are required to be aware of the use of spreadsheets, the internet and multimedia software in relation to accounting. Commercial accounting software packages may be used. The use of word processing software by students to provide theoretical responses is not applicable to the ICT requirement of each unit. Each unit of VCE Accounting involves student application of ICT to record transactions; create reports; model possible outcomes; construct graphical representations and visualisations; and model alternative scenarios. As a guide, students would typically require a minimum of 15 hours of scheduled class time per unit involving ICT to be able to achieve the outcomes for each unit. Knowledge and use of spreadsheets is essential and should be integrated throughout Units 1 to 4. Spreadsheets are used in accounting practice in a variety of ways, including recording inventory; preparing income statements, variance reports, budgets and other accounting information in various formats; numeric calculation; constructing graphical representations (including charts); comparing the results of alternative business options; and analysing data to assist in decision-making. Financial modelling is used to make estimates of how future scenarios will influence the performance of a business through mathematical projections of the key variables affecting the business. ICT is an important tool used in modelling the potential consequences of different future scenarios when making business decisions. Modelling using ICT enables comparison and analysis of the potential consequences of different decisions. In contemporary society, it is essential for an accountant to use critical and creative thinking skills to explore alternatives, and effectively communicate these to key stakeholders, such as business owners.",
