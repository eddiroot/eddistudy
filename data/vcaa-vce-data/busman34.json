Managers regularly review and evaluate business performance through use of key performance indicators and use the results to make decisions affecting the future of a business. Managers can take both a proactive and reactive approach to change. Students investigate the ways a business can search for new business opportunities as a source of future business growth and consider current forces for change on a business. They apply Lewin’s Force Field Analysis theory to contemporary case studies from the past four years and consider approaches to strategic management using Porter’s Generic Strategies. On completion of this unit the student should be able to explain the way business change may come about, analyse why managers may take a proactive or reactive approach to change, use key performance indicators to analyse the performance of a business, explain the driving and restraining forces for change, and evaluate management strategies to position a business for the future.

It is important for managers to know where they want a business to be positioned for the future before implementing a variety of strategies to bring about the desired change. Students consider the importance of leadership in change management and discuss and evaluate effective strategies for managing change. Students consider how leaders can inspire change and the effect change can have on stakeholders of a business. They consider the principles of Senge’s Learning Organisation and apply the Three-step Change Model (Lewin) in implementing change in a business. Using one or more contemporary business case studies from the past four years, students evaluate business practice against theory, considering how corporate social responsibility can be incorporated into the change process. On completion of this unit the student should be able to discuss the importance of effective management strategies and leadership in relation to change, evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of strategies used by managers to implement change, and discuss the effect of change on the stakeholders of a business.
