Students explore the role of individuals, laws and the legal system in achieving social cohesion and protecting the rights of individuals. Students consider the characteristics of an effective law, and sources and types of law. They examine the relationship between parliament and the courts in law-making, and the reasons for a court hierarchy in Victoria, they also develop an understanding of the principles of justice. On completion of this unit the student should be able to describe the main sources and types of law, and evaluate the effectiveness of laws.

In this area of study, students develop an understanding of the purposes of and key concepts in criminal law, as well as the types of crime. They also investigate two criminal offences in detail. For each offence, students consider actual and/or hypothetical scenarios in which an accused has been charged with the offence, use legal reasoning to determine possible culpability and explain the impact of the offence on individuals and society. On completion of this unit the student should be able to explain the purposes and key concepts of criminal law, and use legal reasoning to argue the criminal culpability of an accused based on actual and/or hypothetical scenarios.

Students compare approaches to sentencing in Victoria to one other Australian jurisdiction. Through an investigation of criminal cases from the past four years, students apply their knowledge to discuss the effectiveness of sanctions and the ability of the Victorian criminal justice system to achieve the principles of justice.
