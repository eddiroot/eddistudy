      "description": "Reading and exploring texts In this area of study, students engage in reading and viewing texts with a focus on personal connections with the story. They discuss and clarify the ideas and values presented by authors through their evocations of character, setting and plot, and through investigations of the point of view and/or the voice of the text. They develop and strengthen inferential reading and viewing skills, and consider the ways a text’s vocabulary, text structures and language features can create meaning on several levels and in different ways. Students’ exploration of texts involves understanding and appreciating the role of vocabulary, text structures and language features in creating story and meaning. They contemplate the ways a text can present and reflect human experiences, and how stories or aspects of stories resonate with their own memories and lives. Students are encouraged to share their experience and understanding of the world, and make connections with key ideas, concerns and tensions presented in a text. They also explore the cultural, social and historical values embedded in the text, and can compare these values with their own. It is through these moments of connection that students engage more closely with the reading experience, and draw parallels with their own observations of the world. Through participation in discussions about their own experiences and the ways they make connections with a text, students develop their own thinking and engage with the ideas of others to extend their understanding of a text. They draw on personal experience and understanding in developing writing about a text, and work to shape their ideas and knowledge into formal essay structures. For this outcome, students will read and explore one set text, or extracts from the set text (EAL). This text must be of a different text type from that selected for study in Unit 2. The text selected should reflect the interests of the students and be worthy of close study. Students are provided with opportunities to practise and extend their writing about texts. They are given time and support to extend their writing through reflection, editing and feedback. On completion of this unit the student should be able to make personal connections with, and explore the vocabulary, text structures, language features and ideas in, a text."

      "description": "In this area of study, students engage with and develop an understanding of effective and cohesive writing. They apply, extend and challenge their understanding and use of imaginative, persuasive and informative text through a growing awareness of situated contexts, stated purposes and audience. Students read and engage imaginatively and critically with mentor texts that model effective writing. Through guided reading of mentor texts, students develop an understanding of the diverse ways that vocabulary, text structures, language features and ideas can interweave to craft compelling texts. They consider these texts through knowledge of the ways purpose, context (including mode) and audience influence and shape writing. Both individual and shared reading of mentor texts provides students with opportunities for rich discussion about what constitutes effective writing. Students collaborate through classwork to cultivate their understandings of cohesive and successful texts. Students employ and experiment with the qualities of effective writing in their own work. Considering clear purpose, context (including mode) and audiences for their writing, and through engaging with and expanding on ideas drawn from mentor texts and other reading, they extend their creativity, fluency and range. As they craft their texts, students explore text structures and language features, and ideas. They build a varied vocabulary, which can include abstract and technical language, and apply standard and/or non-standard conventions of language, including syntax and spelling, as appropriate. They are also able to explore other forms of non-standard or informal language including colloquial and idiomatic language such as slang or dialects, where appropriate. The mentor texts can include short stories, speeches or monologues (with transcripts), essays (comment, opinion, reflective, personal), podcasts (with transcripts), poetry/songs, feature articles (including a series of blog or social media postings) and memoirs and biography and can be entire texts or extracts. Students explore and revisit the mentor texts as inspiration for developing their own writing processes, for generation of ideas, and as models for effective writing. They demonstrate their understanding of ideas and application of effective writing strategies in their crafted texts, and can articulate their writing processes in their commentaries. Teachers and students can negotiate ideas and mentor texts that best fit the context and interests of the cohort. Three mentor texts must be studied in depth. Selection of texts is a school-based decision but can be inspired by the ideas listed in the Framework of Ideas (page 23). For details on text selection, see page 13. Teachers are encouraged to augment this area of study with other print and digital texts, in consultation with their students, and to create meaningful and authentic connections with the experiences of their students to empower them to write confidently."

      "description": "Reading and exploring texts In this area of study, students develop their reading and viewing skills, including deepening their capacity for inferential reading and viewing, to further open possible meanings in a text, and to extend their writing in response to text. Students will develop their skills from Unit 1 through an exploration of a different text type from that studied in Unit 1. Students read or view a text, engaging with the ideas, concerns and tensions, and recognise ways vocabulary, text structures, language features and conventions of a text work together to create meaning. Through discussions about representations in a text, they examine the ways readers understand text considering its historical context, and social and cultural values. They also explore the text through the prism of their own cultural knowledge, experiences and understanding of the world, and extend their observations into analytical and abstracted explorations. Developing analytical writing about a text provides students with opportunities to build skills to discuss ideas, apply appropriate metalanguage, integrate evidence from a text to support key points, and explore organisational structures such as formal essays. Students are provided with opportunities to practise and extend their writing about texts. They are given time and support to extend their writing through reflection, editing and feedback. Students read and explore one set text, or extracts from a set text (EAL). The set text for this area of study must be of a different text type from that studied in Unit 1. Students’ understandings and experiences of the world, as well as supplementary texts, can enrich discussions about key ideas presented in the text. For this reason, the text selected should reflect the interest of the students and be worthy of close study. On completion of this unit the student should be able to explore and analyse how the vocabulary, text structures, language features and ideas in a text construct meaning."

      "abbreviation": "U2AOS2",
      "description": "In this area of study, students consider the way arguments are developed and delivered in many forms of media. Through the prism of a contemporary and substantial local and/or national issue, students read, view and listen to a range of texts that attempt to position an intended audience in a particular context. They explore the structure of these texts, including contention, sequence of arguments, use of supporting evidence and persuasive strategies. They closely examine the language and the visuals employed by the author, and offer analysis of the intended effect on the audience. Students apply their knowledge of argument to create a point of view text for oral presentation. Suitable texts for study should reflect a variety of persuasive texts. Appropriate texts could be drawn from print, digital, audio and audio visual sources. These texts may include speeches, digitally presented texts, opinion and comment pieces, and other texts designed to position audiences in relation to an issue. In selecting these texts, teachers should reflect on what students choose to read, view and listen to. Consideration and time should be given to the explicit teaching of contextual information and cultural knowledge required to support an understanding of the selected issue and texts. Students practise analysing persuasive texts using note taking, summaries and short-answer questions, and through formal, analytical writing. When working with audio or audio visual texts, they explore elements of spoken language including intonation, volume, pace, pausing and stress, and develop analysis of the ways these elements contribute to argument and the effect on the audience. Students craft their writing using evidence from the texts to support their analysis. They draft and revise their writing and invite feedback from their teacher and other students to refine their ideas and expression. They aim for coherence, logic and accuracy in their writing. Students employ their understanding of argument to create their own point of view text. They construct this text for oral presentation, and learn about the conventions of oral presentation for persuasive purposes."
