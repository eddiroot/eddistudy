      "description": "Reading and responding to texts In this area of study, students apply reading and viewing strategies to critically engage with a text, considering its dynamics and complexities and reflecting on the motivations of its characters. They analyse the ways authors construct meaning through vocabulary, text structures, language features and conventions, and the presentation of ideas. They are provided with opportunities to understand and explore the historical context, and the social and cultural values of a text, and recognise how these elements influence the way a text is read or viewed, is understood by different audiences, and positions its readers in different ways. Sustained analytical writing about a text provides students with opportunities to further develop skills to engage with and challenge ideas, to refine their application of appropriate metalanguage, to integrate evidence from a text to support key points, and to improve their use of organisational structures such as formal essays. Through participation in discussion, students test their thinking, clarify ideas and form views about a text that can be further developed in their writing. All students are provided with opportunities to practise and extend their writing about texts, and EAL students are provided with a contextual framing of the text through a listening task that explores historical, cultural and/or social values relevant to the text (such as an interview, episode of a podcast, lecture or presentation). Prior to summative assessment, they are given time and support to extend their writing through reflection, editing and feedback. Students study one text selected from the annual VCAA VCE English and EAL Text List. This text must be of a different text type from that which is selected for study in Unit 4. On completion of this unit the student should be able to analyse ideas, concerns and values presented in a text, informed by the vocabulary, text structures and language features and how they make meaning."

      "description": "In this area of study, students build on the knowledge and skills developed through Unit 1. They read and engage imaginatively and critically with mentor texts, and effective and cohesive writing within identified contexts. Through close reading, students expand their understanding of the diverse ways that vocabulary, text structures, language features, conventions and ideas can interweave to create compelling texts. They further consider mentor texts through their understanding of the ways that purpose, context (including mode), and specific and situated audiences influence and shape writing. Students work with mentor texts to inspire their own creative processes, to generate ideas for their writing, and as models for effective writing. They experiment with adaptation and individual creation, and demonstrate insight into ideas and effective writing strategies in their texts. They reflect on the deliberate choices they have made through their writing processes in their commentaries. Students participate in collaborative class work and discuss the ways that vocabulary, text structures and language features can enliven ideas. They read, explore and revisit examples of text, including extracts, to stimulate structural innovation and to inspire ideas when developing individual writing. They also make connections with experiences and events in their own lives, observing and recording to enrich their writing, and to extend their ideas. Students use and experiment with vocabulary, text structures, language features, and standard and non-standard conventions of language, including the use of colloquial and idiomatic language such as slang or dialect where appropriate. Through this engagement they deepen their understanding of how writing can move, provoke and/or inspire when constructed in consideration of a specific and situated audience, purpose and context (including mode). They play with language as they explore ideas and aim for aesthetic appeal, to expand their writing into the possibilities of emotion, imagination, explanation and perspective. The Framework of Ideas to support this area of study can be found on pages 23 and 24. Schools must select one idea from the Framework for study. Mentor texts for each idea will be listed in the annual VCAA VCE English and EAL Text List (List 2). Schools select three mentor texts to support studentsâ€™ study and should augment this area of study with other print and digital texts, in consultation with their students. Consideration should be given to the context of the student cohort, including their wider community, when selecting the idea and the mentor texts. Teachers are encouraged to create meaningful and authentic connections with the selected idea and the experiences of their students, and to work with students to develop strategies to empower them to write confidently and intentionally. On completion of this unit the student should be able to demonstrate effective writing skills by producing their own texts, designed to respond to a specific context and audience to achieve a stated purpose; and to explain their decisions made through writing processes."

      "description": "Reading and responding to texts In this area of study, students further sharpen their skills of reading and viewing texts, developed in the corresponding area of study in Unit 3. Students consolidate their capacity to critically analyse texts and deepen their understanding of the ideas and values a text can convey. Students apply reading and viewing strategies to engage with a text, and discuss and analyse the ways authors construct meaning in a text through the presentation of ideas, concerns and conflicts, and the use of vocabulary, text structures and language features. They engage with the dynamics of a text and explore the explicit and implicit ideas and values presented in a text. They recognise and explain the ways the historical context, and social and cultural values can affect a reader, and analyse how these social and cultural values are presented. They establish how these values can influence the way a text is read or viewed, can be understood by different audiences, and can position readers in different ways. Sustained analytical writing about a text provides students with opportunities to refine skills to engage with and challenge ideas, to confidently apply appropriate metalanguage, to deftly integrate evidence from a text to support key points, and to enhance their use of organisational structures such as formal essays. Through participation in discussion, students test their thinking, clarify ideas and form views about a text that are clearly developed in their writing. Students are provided with opportunities to practise and extend their writing about texts. Prior to summative assessment, they are given time and support to extend their writing through reflection, editing and feedback. Students study one text selected from the annual VCE English and EAL Text List. The text selected for study must be of a different text type from that which is selected for study in Unit 3.

      "abbreviation": "U4AOS2",
      "description": "In this area of study, students analyse the use of argument and language, and visuals in texts that debate a contemporary and significant national or international issue. The texts must have appeared in the media since 1 September of the previous year and teachers are advised to work with their students to select an issue of relevance to the cohort. Students read, view and/or listen to a variety of texts from the media, including print and digital, and audio and audio visual, and develop their understanding of the ways in which arguments and language complement one another to position an intended audience in relation to a selected issue. Students consider the purpose, audience and context of each text, the arguments, and the ways written and spoken language, and visuals are employed for effect. They analyse the ways all these elements work together to influence and/or convince an intended audience. Consideration and time should be given to explicit teaching of the contextual and cultural background of the selected issue and the texts explored. Students must explore and analyse the structures and features of argument presented in audio and/or audio visual texts, and consider the unique structures and features that enhance argument in these contexts. They plan and develop written analyses in response to their explorations. Students practise the skills of revision and editing for clarity and coherence. Students apply their understanding of the use of argument and language to create a point of view text for oral presentation. Through active listening, reading and viewing, students monitor and evaluate arguments on a topic of their choice, and then plan and develop their own point of view text on that topic. They present their points of view as a discussion, dialogue or debate, or in a presentation mode that best suits their context, purpose and audience. On completion of this unit the student should be able to analyse the use of argument and language in persuasive texts, including written text (print or digital) and text in another mode (visual, audio and/or audio visual); and develop and present a point of view text."
