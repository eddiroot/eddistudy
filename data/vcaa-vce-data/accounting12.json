      "description": "Recording financial data and reporting accounting information for a service business In this area of study, students investigate the role of accounting in generating financial data and accounting information. They use the accrual method for determining profit for a service business operating as a sole proprietor with cash and credit transactions. Students use both manual methods and ICT to record financial data and report accounting information. They apply accounting assumptions and qualitative characteristics, and use business documents and indicators to measure business performance in order to evaluate the success or failure of the business. There are many indicators to measure the performance of a business. Some are financial, such as the amount of profit earned compared with investment or total sales made in a given period; while others are based on non-financial information, such as the speed with which invoices are paid, number of customers visiting a store in a given period, or trends in consumer preferences. On completion of this unit, the student should be able to identify and record financial data, report and explain accounting information for a service business, and suggest and apply appropriate financial and non-financial indicators to measure business performance. To achieve this outcome, the student will draw on key knowledge and key skills outlined in Area of Study 2."

      "description": "Information and communications technology: Information and communications technology (ICT) is an essential aspect of business operations increasingly used to capture, model, analyse and convey information. Students are required to be aware of the use of spreadsheets, the internet and multimedia software in relation to accounting. Commercial accounting software packages may be used. The use of word processing software by students to provide theoretical responses is not applicable to the ICT requirement of each unit. Each unit of VCE Accounting involves student application of ICT to record transactions; create reports; model possible outcomes; construct graphical representations and visualisations; and model alternative scenarios. As a guide, students would typically require a minimum of 15 hours of scheduled class time per unit involving ICT to be able to achieve the outcomes for each unit. Knowledge and use of spreadsheets is essential and should be integrated throughout Units 1 to 4. Spreadsheets are used in accounting practice in a variety of ways, including recording inventory; preparing income statements, variance reports, budgets and other accounting information in various formats; numeric calculation; constructing graphical representations (including charts); comparing the results of alternative business options; and analysing data to assist in decision-making. Financial modelling is used to make estimates of how future scenarios will influence the performance of a business through mathematical projections of the key variables affecting the business. ICT is an important tool used in modelling the potential consequences of different future scenarios when making business decisions. Modelling using ICT enables comparison and analysis of the potential consequences of different decisions. In contemporary society, it is essential for an accountant to use critical and creative thinking skills to explore alternatives, and effectively communicate these to key stakeholders, such as business owners.",
