      "abbreviation": "U3AOS1",
      "description": "In this area of study, students use Newton’s laws of motion to analyse linear motion, circular motion and projectile motion. Newton’s laws of motion give important insights into a range of motion both on Earth and beyond through the investigations of objects on land and in orbit. They explore the motion of objects under the influence of a gravitational field on the surface of Earth, close to Earth and above Earth. They explore the relationships between force, energy and mass. On completion of this unit the student should be able to investigate motion and related energy transformations experimentally, and analyse motion using Newton’s laws of motion in one and two dimensions."

In this area of study, students examine the similarities and differences between three fields: gravitational, electric and magnetic. Students explore how positions in fields determine the potential energy of, and the force on, an object. They investigate how concepts related to field models can be applied to construct motors, maintain satellite orbits and to accelerate particles including in a synchrotron. On completion of this unit the student should be able to analyse gravitational, electric and magnetic fields, and apply these to explain the operation of motors and particle accelerators, and the orbits of satellites."

In this area of study, students use empirical evidence and models of electric, magnetic and electromagnetic effects to explain how electricity is produced and delivered to homes. They explore the transformer as critical to the performance of electrical distribution systems in minimising power loss. On completion of this unit the student should be able to analyse and evaluate an electricity generation and distribution system."

      "description": "In this area of study, students learn how understanding of light, matter and motion have changed over time. They explore how major experiments led to the development of theories to describe these fundamental aspects of the physical world. When light and matter are probed, they appear to have remarkable similarities. Light, previously described as an electromagnetic wave, appears to exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Findings that electrons behave in a wave-like manner challenged thinking about the relationship between light and matter. Students consider the limitations of classical mechanics as they explore Einstein’s view of the Universe. They consider postulates as distinct from theories and explore ideas related to objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. They use special relativity to explore length contraction and time dilation as observations are made by observers in different frames of reference, and the interrelationship between matter and energy."

      "description": "Students undertake a student-designed scientific investigation in either Unit 3 or Unit 4, or across both Units 3 and 4. The investigation involves the generation of primary data relating to fields, motion or light. The investigation draws on knowledge and related key science skills developed across Units 3 and 4 and is undertaken by students in the laboratory and/or in the field. When undertaking the investigation students are required to apply the key science skills to develop a question, state an aim, formulate a hypothesis and plan a course of action to answer the question, while complying with safety and ethical guidelines. Students then undertake an investigation to generate primary quantitative data, analyse and evaluate the data, identify limitations of data and methods, link experimental results to scientific ideas, discuss implications of the results, and draw and evaluate a conclusion in response to the question. Students are expected to design and undertake an investigation involving one continuous independent variable. The presentation format for the investigation is a scientific poster constructed according to the structure outlined on page 13. A logbook is maintained by the students for record, assessment and authentication purposes."

Use appropriate numbers of significant figures in calculations. Plot graphs involving two variables that show linear and non-linear relationships. Identify and analyse experimental data qualitatively, handling, where appropriate, concepts of: accuracy, precision, repeatability, reproducibility, resolution, and validity of measurements; and errors (random and systematic). Identify outliers, and contradictory, provisional or incomplete data. Repeat experiments to evaluate the precision of data. Evaluate investigation methods and suggest ways to improve precision, and to reduce the likelihood of errors)",

Evaluate data to determine the degree to which the evidence supports or refutes the initial prediction or hypothesis.

Analyse and explain how models and theories are used to organise and understand observed phenomena and concepts, identifying limitations of selected models/theories. Critically evaluate and interpret a range of scientific and media texts (including journal articles, mass media communications and opinions in the public domain), processes, claims and conclusions related to chemistry by considering the quality of available evidence. Apply sustainability concepts to analyse and evaluate responses to chemistry-based scenarios, case studies, issues and challenges. Identify and explain when judgements or decisions associated with chemistry-related issues may be based on sociocultural, economic, political, legal and/or ethical factors and not solely on scientific evidence. Use clear, coherent and concise expression to communicate to specific audiences and for specific purposes in appropriate scientific genres, including scientific reports and posters.
