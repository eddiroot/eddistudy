Recall that photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, in the form of glucose. This vital process occurs in two main stages: the **light-dependent reactions** (which capture light energy and produce ATP and NADPH) and the **light-independent reactions** (also known as the Calvin cycle, which use ATP and NADPH to fix carbon dioxide into glucose). Understanding how external conditions impact these stages is crucial for comprehending plant productivity and ecosystem function. We will explore how light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and water availability each play a role, often interacting with one another."

Recall that photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, in the form of glucose. This vital process occurs in two main stages: the **light-dependent reactions** (which capture light energy and produce ATP and NADPH) and the **light-independent reactions** (also known as the Calvin cycle, which use ATP and NADPH to fix carbon dioxide into glucose). Understanding how external conditions impact these stages is crucial for comprehending plant productivity and ecosystem function. We will explore how light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and water availability each play a role, often interacting with one another."

Comparison and evaluation of biological concepts, methodologies and findings.\nDetailed example How can drought resistant crops be identified? Comparison and evaluation of biological concepts, methodologies and findings. As adapted from 'Observing transpiration', 'Stomata leaf peel' and 'Preparing a leaf epidermal peel' ( GRDC , GTAC ). Aim Explore the concept of transpiration by creating a controlled environment by which this process can be monitored and measured (Part A). Compare the epidermal cellular structures (such as stomata) from the leaves of different wheat varieties. Suggest which might be best for a low rainfall environment (Part B). Key science skills Identify, inform and teach students the relevant Unit 1\u20134 Biology Key science skills that are embedded in the task. Introduction Most wheat cropping in Australia relies on rainfall because there is no option for irrigation or it is too expensive for larger scale farms. Australian grain growers regularly check weather updates from the Bureau of Meteorology. Farmers need the rain to fall at the right time and in the right place. Unfortunately, due largely to climate change, Australian farming areas are being plagued by periods of low rainfall, hot weather, dry winds and drought. In these conditions, plants can struggle to grow, survive and reproduce. Water movement throughout a plant is essential to its ability to grow, survive and reproduce. In a farming system, growers are keen for the plant to use every millimetre of water. From a scientific point of view, they want to offer farmers a variety that has the best adaptive traits possible. The CSIRO ( ECOS ) has found plants that, with adaptations, are higher yielding under drought conditions and better at maintaining growth. This is reflected in the fact that they keep their stomata open longer when stressed during flowering. Sensitive plants close those stomata quickly under stress and stop growing. Stomata control transpiration of water and photosynthesis and thereby regulate growth and grain production. Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water. Plants collect water from the soil through their root hairs via a process of osmosis. The water then travels up through the plant to the leaves where it is lost as the water diffuses into the surrounding air. On the outer layer of the leaf of a plant are microscopic holes called 'stomata'. Stomata control gas exchange and water loss by opening and closing. They are of particular interest to plant breeders because plants with smaller or fewer stomata tend to have lower levels of evaporation. Part A: Investigating transpiration using a controlled experiment Equipment 2 x clear measuring cylinders Square of cardboard Small cuttings of plant(s) (preferably crop plants \u2013 wheat, rye, corn, sunflower, beans, peas, radishes, lettuce, any other vegetable) Blue Tack Water Scissors Timer Pen Method Make a hole in the centre of the cardboard big enough for the stem. Put the stem of the cutting through this hole and seal the remaining space with Blue Tack. Fill one cup with water and mark the water level with a pen. Put the bottom of the cutting in the water and place the second cup over the top of the leaves of the plant. Place in the sun and observe for 20 minutes. Record your observations. Discussion questions/suggested annotations when report writing in the logbook A series of four to six graded questions that address the data and the implications of the relationship for cell survival should be set for students to answer in their logbook, for example: Identify \u2013 What are the dependent, independent and controlled variables in your investigation? Explain \u2013 What did you observe? What percentage of water was taken up by the plant? Explain the observations in terms of osmosis and transpiration. Apply \u2013 Which plants would be recommended as crops? Support your claims with evidence. Propose \u2013 What further tests could be performed to investigate transpiration rates in plants? Outline a method for a further test. Part B: Investigating stomata using a controlled experiment Investigate stomatal aperture from three different plant varieties. Procedure Stomata may be isolated and viewed under a light or digital microscope using a variety of methods, including using nail polish and sticky tape or peeling a thin epidermal layer from the leaf. Results Draw and label any points of stomata difference between the varieties and between the top and bottom of the leaf. Clearly label the stomata, guard cells and any other organelles you see. Describe the stomatal aperture, describing the appearance of guard cells. Explain why the lower epidermis of a leaf has more stomata than the upper epidermis. Which variety had the most stomata? Discussion questions/suggested annotations when report writing in the logbook A series of four to six graded questions that address the data and the implications of the relationship for cell survival should be set for students to answer in their logbook, for example: Identify \u2013 What are the dependent, independent and controlled variables in your investigation?

Explain the observations in terms of stomatal opening and guard cell appearance. Apply \u2013 Which plants would be recommended as crops in drought conditions? Evidence your reasoning using your results from both Parts A and B. Propose \u2013 What further tests could be performed to investigate stomatal aperture and opening rates in plants? Outline a method for a further test. Extension Compare Australian native plants ( Mallee.pdf ) and Australian crop plants with transpiration rates, stomata location and opening. Which would you suggest would be better suited as crop plants? Explain why. Identify and describe possible social, ethical and economic issues.",
